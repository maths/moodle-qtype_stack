# STACK 4.3.7 [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/maths/moodle-qtype_stack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/github/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/)

STACK is an assessment system for mathematics, science and related disciplines.  STACK is a question type for the Moodle learning management system, and also the ILIAS learning management system.

STACK was created by [Chris Sangwin](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~csangwin/) of the University of Edinburgh, and includes the work of many [other contributors](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/About/Credits.md). A demonstration server is available at the University of Edinburgh:  [https://stack.maths.ed.ac.uk/](https://stack.maths.ed.ac.uk/).

STACK is based on continuing research and use at the University of Edinburgh, the Open University, Aalto, Loughborough University, the University of Birmingham and others.
