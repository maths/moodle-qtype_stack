# STACK 4.3.11

STACK is an assessment system for mathematics, science and related disciplines.  STACK is a question type for the Moodle learning management system, and also the ILIAS learning management system.

STACK was created by [Chris Sangwin](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~csangwin/) of the University of Edinburgh, and includes the work of many [other contributors](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/About/Credits.md). A demonstration server is available at the University of Edinburgh:  [https://stack.maths.ed.ac.uk/](https://stack.maths.ed.ac.uk/).

STACK is based on continuing research and use at the University of Edinburgh, the Open University, Aalto, Loughborough University, the University of Birmingham and others.

## Current state of development

STACK 4.3 contains some important re-engineering of core components.  This will enable significant new features in future releases.  STACK 4.3.11 contains an update of JSXGraph (in advance of the forthcoming 4.4 release) to facilitate immediate materials development.

Please continue to report any bugs you find at https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/issues.

The STACK project has been running since 2005, and we are committed to long term support within Moodle.  We aim to maintain this plugin to work with versions of Moodle, both currently supported and current security releases, see [Moodle versions](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Releases#Version_support) for more details.
