# STACK 4.8.5

STACK is an assessment system for mathematics, science and related disciplines.  STACK is a question type for the Moodle learning management system, and also the ILIAS learning management system.  STACK has an API for stand-alone integration into other 3rd party systems.

The main STACK project website is [https://stack-assessment.org/](https://stack-assessment.org/).

STACK was created by [Chris Sangwin](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~csangwin/) of the University of Edinburgh, and includes the work of many [other contributors](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/About/Credits.md). 
STACK is based on continuing research and use at the University of Edinburgh, the Open University, Aalto, Loughborough University, the University of Birmingham and others.

## Current state of development

For general authoring support please see the Zulip chat [https://stack-assessment.zulipchat.com/](https://stack-assessment.zulipchat.com/).  Please continue to report any bugs you find at [https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/issues](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/issues).

The STACK project has been running since 2005, and we are committed to long term support within Moodle.  We aim to maintain this plugin to work with versions of Moodle, both currently supported and current security releases, see [Moodle versions](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Releases#Version_support) for more details.  We are also committed to support STACK within ILIAS.  If your version of Moodle or ILIAS is not listed as supported please do contact the developers for more information.

The [current state of development](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/Developer/Development_track.md) is explained more fully in the [developer documentation](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/Developer/index.md).
