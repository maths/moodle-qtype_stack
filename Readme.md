# abacus branch of STACK (BETA)

# STACK 3.5.7, Abacus 1.4.2

[STACK](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/About/index.md) is an open-source system for computer-aided assessment in Mathematics and related disciplines, with emphasis on formative assessment.

STACK was created by [Chris Sangwin](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~csangwin/) of the University of Edinburgh, and includes the work of many [other contributors](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/About/Credits.md). A demonstration server is available in Edinburgh:  [https://stack.maths.ed.ac.uk/demo](https://stack.maths.ed.ac.uk/demo).
Notably, this branch contains significant contributions by Matti Harjula of Aalto, Finland.

## Current state of development

This branch of the code contains some major changes from the previous versions, notably the question blocks from Aalto Finland.
Originally intended as "STACK 3.4", these changes are significant enough for this to scheduled as "STACK 4.0". 

Abacus 1.4.2 is hopefully the final Abacus release, the next step will be a merger with master and equiv_input branches expected for the fall semester of 2017.

Please continue to report any bugs you find at https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/issues.
