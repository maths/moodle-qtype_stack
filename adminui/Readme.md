# STACK administration UI

The scripts in this directory allow users to perform STACK admin functions.  Typically these are general or bulk tasks.  Individual question task scripts are one level up (e.g. deploy, exportone, question tests).  These scripts are available through Moodle, but are not accessible to students or in most cases typical teachers.

Users typically require capability `qtype/stack:usediagnostictools`.

Some scripts here may be temporary for the convenience of developers.
