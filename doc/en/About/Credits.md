# Translation of the STACK Project

STACK is designed to support the straightforward addition of other language packs. If you have translated STACK into other languages - or would be interested in doing so - please [let us know](mailto:C.J.Sangwin@ed.ac.uk)! Likewise, if you would really like to see STACK in another language please contact us.  Details of how to add language packs, translate STACK, and forthcoming translations, are given on the [Language packs](../Developer/Language_packs.md) developers page.

STACK is released in many languages, using Moodle's ATOS language system.
