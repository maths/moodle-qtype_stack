# Publications

STACK is a very popular online assessment system, used by many groups in a variety of languages.  STACK has been the subject of research, and has itself enabled research projects to take place. This page contains a selection of publications.  

### Publicity materials.

We have a booklet of [case studies](https://docs.stack-assessment.org/content/2019-cate-case-studies.pdf), and a PDF flyer about the [STACK project](https://docs.stack-assessment.org/content/2018-STACK.pdf).

We have a "Getting started with STACK" [guide](https://docs.stack-assessment.org/content/2019-STACK-Guide.pdf) ([Spanish](https://docs.stack-assessment.org/content/content/es/2019-STACK-Guide.pdf)).
