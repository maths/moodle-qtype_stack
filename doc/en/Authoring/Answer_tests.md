# Answer tests

An _answer test_ is used to compare two expressions to
establish whether they satisfy some mathematical criteria. The
prototype test is to establish if they are the _same_.  That is
to say, _algebraically equivalent_.

The exact behaviour of each answer test can be seen from
STACK's [test suite for STACK Answer tests](../../../answertests.php).

This compares pairs of expressions and displays the outcomes
from each test. Mainly used to ensure STACK is working, it is
invaluable for understanding what each test really does.  In
particular it enables authors to see examples of which
expressions are the same and different together with examples
of the automatically generated feedback.  This feedback can be
suppressed using the `quiet` tickbox in the potential response
tree node.


# Introduction #

Informally, the answer tests have the following syntax

    [Errors, Result, FeedBack, Note] = AnswerTest(StudentAnswer, TeacherAnswer, Opt)

Where,

| Variable        | Description
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| StudentAnswer   | A CAS expression, assumed to be the student's answer.
| TeacherAnswer   | A CAS expression, assumed to be the model answer.
| Opt             | Any options which the specific answer test provides. For example, a variable, the accuracy of the numerical comparison, number of significant figures.

Note that since the tests can provide feedback, tests which appear to be symmetrical,
e.g. Algebraic Equivalence, really need to assume which expression belongs to the student and which to the teacher.

| Variable  | Description
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Errors    | Hopefully this will be empty!
| Result    | is either `true`, `false`, or `fail` (which indicates a failure of the test).  This determines which branch of the tree is traversed.
| FeedBack  | This is a text string which is displayed to the student. It is [CASText](CASText.md) which may depend on properties of the student's answer.
| Note      | This is a text string which is used for [Reporting](Reporting.md). Each answer note is concatenated with the previous notes and any contributions from the branch.

The feedback is only shown to a student if the quiet option is set to 'no'.  If feedback is shown, then examples are given in the answer test test suite.  Login as the admin user then navigate to

# Equality #

A crucial component in the assessment process the ability to decide if two expressions are equal.

Let us assume a teacher has asked a student to expand out \((x+1)^2\) and the response they have from one student is \(x^2+x+x+1\).
This is "correct" in the sense that it is algebraically equivalent to \((x+1)^2\) and is in expanded form
(actually two separate mathematical properties) but "incorrect" in the sense that the student has not _gathered like terms_ by performing an addition \(x+x\).
What about a response \(2x+x^2+1\)?  This is, arguably, better in the sense that the terms are gathered,
but the student here an not _ordered_ terms to write their expression in canonical form.
Hence, we need quite a number of different answer tests to establish equality in various senses of the word.

| Test                                              | Description
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| CasEqual                                          | Are the parse trees of the two expressions equal?  
| [EqualComAss](Answer_tests.md#EqualComAss)        | Are they equal up to commutativity and associativity of addition and multiplication, together with their inverses minus and division? For example \[a+b=b+a\mbox{,}\] but \[x+x\neq 2x\mbox{.}\] This is very useful in elementary algebra, where we want the form of the answer exactly. Simplification is automatically switched off when this test is applied, otherwise it makes no sense.
| [AlgEquiv](Answer_tests.md#AlgEquiv)              | Are they _algebraically equivalent_, i.e. does the difference simplify to zero?
| SubstEquiv                                        | Can we find a substitution of the variables of \(ex_2\) into \(ex_1\) which renders \(ex_1\) algebraically equivalent to \(ex_2\)?  If you are only interested in ignoring case sensitivity, you can apply the [Maxima commands defined by STACK](../CAS/Maxima.md#Maxima_commands_defined_by_STACK) `exdowncase(ex)` to the arguments, before you apply one of the other answer tests.
| SameType                                          | Are the two expressions of the same [types_of_object](../CAS/Maxima.md#Types_of_object)?  Note that this test works recursively over the entire expression.
| SysEquiv                                          | Do two systems of polynomial equations have the same solutions? This test determines whether two systems of multivariate polynomials, i.e. polynomials with a number of variables, generate the same ideal, equivalent to checking they have the same solutions.


### AlgEquiv {#AlgEquiv}

This is the most commonly used test.  The pseudo code

    If
      simplify(ex1-ex2) = 0
    then
      true
    else
      false.

This test will work with a variety of [types of object](../CAS/Maxima.md#Types_of_object) of mathematical objects, including lists, sets, equations, inequalities and matrices.

* This test disregards whether [simplification](../CAS/Simplification.md) is switched on, it always fully simplifies all its arguments.
* Use `AlgEquiv(predicate(ex),true)` with [predicate functions](../CAS/Predicate_functions.md).

Note: exactly what it does depends on what objects are given to it.  In particular the pseudo code above only applies to expressions.  We cannot subtract one list or set from another, so we have to use other tests.

For sets, the CAS tries to write the expression in a canonical form.  It then compares the string representations these forms to remove duplicate elements and compare sets.  This is subtly different from trying to simplify the difference of two expressions to zero.  For example, imagine we have \(\{(x-a)^{6000}\}\) and \(\{(a-x)^{6000}\}\).  One canonical form is to expand out both sides.  While this work in principal, in practice this is much too slow for assessment. 

Currently, \(\{-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3}}\}\) and \(\{-\frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}\}\) are considered to be different.  If you want these to be considered the same you need to write them in a canonical form.   Instead of passing in just the sets, use the answer test to compare the following.

    ev(radcan({-sqrt(2)/sqrt(3)}),simp);
    ev(radcan({-2/sqrt(6)}),simp);

Why doesn't the test automatically apply `radcan`?  If we always did this, then \(\{(x-a)^{6000}\}\) and \(\{(a-x)^{6000}\}\) would be expanded out, which would break the system.  Since, in a given situation, we know a lot about what a student is likely to answer we can apply an appropriate form.   There isn't one rule which will work here, unfortunately.

There are also some cases which Maxima can't establish as being equivalent.  For example \[ \sqrt[3]{\sqrt{108}+10}-\sqrt[3]{sqrt{108}-10} = 2.\]  As Maxima code

    (sqrt(108)+10)^(1/3)-(sqrt(108)-10)^(1/3)

This is Cardano's example from Ars Magna, but currently the AlgEquiv test cannot establish these are equialent.  There are some other examples in the test suite which fail for mathematical reasons.  In cases like this, where you know you have a number, you may need to suppliment the AlgEquiv test with another numerical test.

### EqualComAss: Equality up to Associativity and Commutativity ### {#EqualComAss}

This test seeks to establish whether two expressions are the same when the basic arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication are assumed to be nouns but are commutative and associative.  Hence, \(2x+y=y+2x\) but \(x+x+y\neq 2x+y\).  The unary minus commutes with multiplication in a way natural to establishing the required form of equivalence.

Notice that this test does not include laws of indices, so \(x\times x \neq x^2\). Since we are dealing only with nouns \(-\times -\) does not simplify to \(1\). E.g. \(-x\times -x \neq x\times x \neq x^2\).  This also means that \(\sqrt{x}\) is not considered to be equivalent to \(x^{\frac{1}{2}\) under this test.  In many situations this notation is taken mean the same thing, but internally in Maxima they are represented by different functions and not converted to a cannonical form by the test.  Extra re-write rules could be added to achieve this, which would change the equivalence classes.

This is a particularly useful test for checking that an answer is written in a particular form, e.g. "simplified".

### CasEqual ###

The CAS returns the result of the simple Maxima command

    if StudentAnswer=TeacherAnswer then true else false.

There is no explicit simplification here (unlike AlgEquiv).
This test always assumes [simplification](../CAS/Simplification.md) is off, i.e. `simp:false`, regardless of any question settings.  If this is too strict, use `ev(ex,simp)` in the arguments to simplify them explicitly first.
When simplification is off this test effectively tests whether the parse trees are identical. 

Please note, the behaviour of this test relies on the internal representation of expressions by Maxima, rather than an explicit mathematical property such as "equivalence".  Explicit properties should be tested in preference to using this test!

### SysEquiv ###

The SysEquiv (system equivalence) test takes in two lists of polynomial equations in any number of variables and determines whether the two systems have the same set of solutions.
This is done using the theory of Gröbner bases to determine whether the ideals generated by the two systems are equal.
As the test allows for polynomials in several variables, it can cope with the intersections of the conic sections, as well as a large number of geometrically interesting curves.

* This test disregards whether [simplification](../CAS/Simplification.md) is switched on, it only simplifies its arguments where required.
This allows the test to list equations in feedback that the student has erroneously included in their system.

# Form {#Form}

Often we wish to establish if the student's expression has the correct _form_.
For example, consider the following various written forms of \(x^2-4x+4\).

\[(x-2)(x-2),\quad (x-2)^2,\quad  (2-x)^2,\quad  4\left(1-\frac{x}{2}\right)^2.\]

Each of these might be considered to be factored.  **Establishing `ex` is factored is not the same as comparing it with**

    factor(ex)

Related tests establish that an expression is _expanded_ or in _partial_

| Expression        | Description
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| LowestTerms       | This test checks that all numbers written in the first expression are in lowest terms.  Notes
|                   |     * if you want to check whether a rational polynomial is written in lowest terms, this is not the test to use.  Instead, apply the [predicate functions](../CAS/Predicate_functions.md)  `lowesttermsp` to the expression.
|                   |     * the second argument to this function is ignored, i.e. this test does not confirm algebraic equivalence.  You might as well use 0 here.
| Expanded          | Confirms SAns is equal to `expand(SAns)`.  Note, the second argument to this answer test is not used (but must be non-empty).  Note with this test that an expression such as \(x^2-(a+b)x+ab\) is not considered to be expanded, and this test will return false.
| FacForm           | This test checks (i) that SAns is algebraically equivalent to TAns , and (ii) that SAns is "factored" over the rational numbers. See below for more details.  The answer test expects the option to be the variable, which is needed to generate feedback. If the answer is incorrect, quite detailed feedback is provided.
| SingleFrac        | This test checks (i) that SAns is algebraically equivalent to TAns , and (ii) that SAns is written as a single fraction. Notes
|                   |     * if you also want this expression written in lowest terms, then this is quite a separate test.  You need to first confirm you have a single fraction then add a new potential response. One way is to use the [../CAS/Predicate functions](../CAS/Predicate_functions.md) `lowesttermsp(ex)` and compare the result with `true` with the AlgEquiv test.
|                   |     * The algebraic equivalence check is for convenience.  If you only want to check an expression is a single fraction make \(SAns=TAns\), i.e. ATSingleFrac(ex,ex) will do.
| PartFrac          | This test checks (i) that SAns is algebraically equivalent to TAns , and (ii) that SAns is in "partial fraction form". The option must be the variable.
| CompletedSquare   | This test checks (i) that SAns is algebraically equivalent to TAns , and (ii) that SAns is in "completed square form". The option must be the variable.

# Factorisation of polynomials {#FacPoly}

An expression is said to be factored if it is written as a
product of powers of distinct irreducible factors.   Strictly
speaking, in establishing that an expression is in factored
form, we might not even care whether the terms in the product
are fully simplified, as long as they are irreducible.

Irreducibility on the other hand means we can't find further factors, but here we need some care.

Consider \(x^8+16x^4+48\).

1. Any non-trivial factorization, e.g. \((x^4+4)(x^4+12)\).
2. A factorization into irreducible factors over the integers/rational numbers, i.e. \((x^2+2x+x)(x^2-2x+2)(x^4+12)\).
3. A factorization into terms irreducible over the reals, i.e. \((x^2+2x+x)(x^2-2x+2)(x^2+2\sqrt[4]{3}x+2\sqrt[4]{3})(x^2-2\sqrt[4]{3}x+2\sqrt[4]{3})\).
4. A factorization into irreducible polynomials over the Gaussian integers, with \(i\) allowed, i.e. \((x+1+i)(x+1-i)(x-1+i)(x-1-i)(x^4+12)\).
5. A factorization over the complex numbers, where the factor \((x^4+12)\) would also be split into the four terms \(x\pm\sqrt[4]{3}(1\pm i)\).

In elementary teaching, meaning 4. is unlikely to occur.
Indeed, we might take this example to represent factoring over
any extension field of the rationals.  We normally seek to
establish that the factors are irreducible over the integers
(which is equivalent to irreducibility over the rational
numbers) or the reals.  But, unlike a canonical form, we are
not particularly interested in the order of the terms in this
product, or the order of summands inside these terms.

The FacForm test establishes that the expression is factored
over the rational numbers.  If the coefficients of the
polynomial are all real, at worst you will have quadratic
irredicible terms.  There are some delicate cases such as:
\((2-x)(3-x)\) vs  \((x-2)(x-3)\)  and \((1-x)^2\) vs \((x-1)^2\),
which this test will cope with.

# Precision {#Precision}

These tests deal with the precision of numbers.  Please see the notes on [entering numbers](../CAS/Numbers.md).  

| Expression    | Description
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| NumRelative   | Tests whether `abs(sa-ta) <= opt * abs(ta)` Hence the opt is a tolerance.
| NumAbsolute   | Tests whether `abs(sa-ta) < opt`  Hence the opt is a tolerance. The default tolerance is 0.05.
| NumSigFigs    | Tests (i) whether the student's answer contains `opt` significant figures, and (ii) whether the answer is accurate to `opt` significant figures.   If the option is a list \([n,m]\) then we check the answer has been written to \(n\) significant figures, with an accuracy of \(m\) places.  A common test would be to ask for \([n,n-1]\) to permit the student to enter the last digit incorrectly.
| NumDecPlaces  | (Not yet released, see notes below) Tests (i) whether the student's answer is equivalent to the teacher's and is written to `opt` decimal places.  The option, which must be a positive integer, dictates the number of digits following the decimal separator `.`.  Note that trailing zeros are ''required'', i.e. to two decimal placed you must write `12.30` not just `12.3`.  The test rounds the numbers to the specified number of decimal places before trying to establish equivalence.
| GT            | "Greater than".  Both arguments are assumed to be numbers. The Answer test fully simplifies the SAns and converts this to a float if possible. This is needed to cope with expressions involving sums of surds, \(\pi\) etc.
| GTE           | "Greater than or equal to". See above.

NumRelative  and NumAbsolute can also accept lists and sets.  Elements are automatically converted to floats and simplified (i.e. `ev(float(ex),simp)`) and are compared to the teacher's answer using the appropriate numerical test and accuracy.  A uniform accuracy must be used.  With lists the order is important, but with sets it is not.  Checking two sets are approximately equal is an interesting mathematical problem....

Decimal places test.  This test is implemented, and the code works, however it cannot be used in STACK because of difficulties with validation.  To fully implement this we need an "ephemeral form" for floating point numbers, which will require some more work.


# Calculus #

### Diff ###

This test is a general differentiation test. The first argument is the student's answer. The answer test options needs to be the variable.

### Int ###

This test is designed for a general indefinite integration question. The first argument is the student's answer.
The second argument is the model answer. The answer test option needs to be the variable with respect to which integration is assumed to take place, or a list (see below).

Getting this test to work in a general setting is a very difficult challenge.
In particular, the test assumes that the constant of integration is expressed in a form similar to +c, although which variable used is not important.

The issue of \( \int \frac{1}{x} dx = \log(x)+c\) vs  \( \int \frac{1}{x} dx 
= \log(|x|)+c\) is a particular challenge.  The test is currently defined in 
such a way that if the teacher uses \( \log(|x|)+c \) in their answer, then 
they would expect the student to do so.  If they don't use the absolute value 
function, then they don't expect students to but will accept this in an 
answer.   It is, after all, not "wrong".  However, in the case of partial 
fractions where there are more than one term of the form \(\log(x-a)\) then 
we insist the student is at least consistent.  If the teacher has *any* 
\(\log(|x-a|)\) then the student must use \(|...|\) in *all* of them.  If the 
teacher has no \(\log(|x-a|)\) (i.e. just things like \(\log(x-a)\)) then the 
student must have all or none. 

The ATInt test has various additional options.

The question author must supply these options in the form of a list `[var, opt1, ...]`.  The first argument of this list must be the variable with respect to which integration is taking place.  

If one of the `opt?` is exactly the token `NOCONST` then the test will condone a lack of constant of integration.  That is, if a student has missed off a constant of integration, or the answers differ by a numerical constant, then full marks will be awarded.  Wierd constants (e.g. \(+c^2\)) will still be flagged up.

The answer test archtecture only passes in the *answer* to the test.  The question is not available at that point, however, the answer test has to infer exactly which expression, including the algebraic form, the teacher has set in the question. This includes stripping off constants of integration and constants of integration may occur in a number of ways, e.g. in logarithms.
In many cases simply differentiating the teacher's answer is fine, in which case the question author need not worry.  Where this does not work, the question author will need to supply the expression from the question in the right form as an option to the answer test.  This is done simply by adding it to the list of options.

    [x, x*exp(5*x+7)]

The test cannot cope with some situations.  Please contact the developers when you find some of these.  This test is already rather overloaded, so please don't expect every request to be accommodated! 

# Other #

The following tests do not use Maxima, but instead rely on PHP.

| Expression     | Description
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| String         | This is a string match, ignoring leading and trailing white space which are stripped from all answers, using PHP's trim() function.
| StringSloppy   | This function first converts both inputs to lower case, then removes all white space from the string and finally performs a strict string comparison.
| RegExp         | A regular expression match, with the expression passed via the option. This regular expression match is performed with PHP's `preg_match()` function. For example, if you want to test if a string looks like a floating point number then use the regular expression `{[0-9]*\.[0-9]*}`
|                | **NOTE:** this rest used to use PHP's `ereg()` function which has now been depricated.
