# Testing

Computer aided assessment of mathematics works in the following phases.

1. [Authoring](../Authoring/)
2. [Testing](Testing.md)
3. [Deploying](Deploying.md)
4. [Reviewing](Reviewing.md)

## Testing for quality control  ##

It is important to test questions to ensure they work correctly.  One approach would be for the teacher
to repeatedly test them with various random numbers and inputs.  But this is inefficient and unreliable.

Question Tests provide an automated mechanism through which the author may establish with confidence that
the Potential Response Trees are processing the student answer as expected. They are based on the concept of "unit testing" from software development.
Question variables can be included in the tests, indeed these are needed to define test inputs in the context of random values.

Each test assigns values to

1. any/all of the inputs.  These values may, naturally, depend on the
   [question variables](KeyVals.md#Question_variables).
2. values for the score and any penalty.
3. [Answer notes](Potential_response_trees.md#Answer_note) from each of
   the [potential response trees](Potential_response_trees.md).

The teacher can opt to run the question tests from the preview window.  STACK automatically takes each test, assigns the values to inputs and attempts to submit it.  The results of the last answer note from each potential response tree is compared to that specified by the teacher.  Notice this is a limitation of the system.  Specifying the complete route through the potential response tree would be too difficult and would discourage teachers from writing tests.

If the score, penalty and answer note generated by each potential response tree matches that specified by the teacher, then the test will PASS, otherwise the test will FAIL. Note that failure of a test is a mismatch between outputs and expected outputs, not necessarily a sign that something is wrong with the question itself!

The teacher can also examine by hand the outcomes generated by each step of each test, including full feedback generated.

0In this way, the teacher can record, within the question itself, how they expect the marking scheme to work for a variety of student answers.

_Note_: currently only the last Answer Note, not the whole path through the potential response tree, is examined.


When you are done testing a question which uses randomization, you need to [deploy instances](Deploying.md) of it.
