# Graphics in STACK questions

Graphics (which can be produced to be dependent on Question Variables) can be placed into any of the [CASText](./Authoring/CASText.md) fields.
There are several different ways in which graphics can be generated. These include the following.

* Including an image file, using the HTML `<img>` tag.
* [Using the STACK `plot`command, which is a wrapper to the Maxima `plot2d` command.](CAS/Plots.md)
* Using SVG commands.
* Using jsXgraph commands. 

Remember that when including a graphic in a question, to ensure the question is accessible to, for example, screen-reader users, authors should always include an appropriate figure description/alt-text.
