# Section documentation for /expressions/extraction

Functions for extracting parts from expressions, i.e., trees of operations.


## extract_matching_parts<a id='extract_matching_parts'></a>

Given a predicate, returns a list of all the subtrees of the expression
matching that predicate. Including subtrees inside previously matched
subtrees.

Note this is largely the same as Maximas format packages `matching_parts`.

@param[lamda/function] pred, a single argument predicate function
@param[expression] ex, an expression that may contain parts matching that predicate
@return[list] the matching subtrees in arbitrary order, could be empty
