Functions for extracting parts from expressions, i.e., trees of operations.


## extract_matching_parts(predicate,expression)<a id='extract_matching_parts'></a>

Given a predicate, returns a list of all the subtrees of the expression
matching that predicate. Including subtrees inside previously matched
subtrees.

Note this is largely the same as Maximas format packages `matching_parts`.

| Argument name | type | description |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| predicate | lamda/function | a single argument predicate function |
| expression | expression | an expression that may contain parts matching that predicate |


| Return type | description |
| ----------- | ------------|
| list | the matching subtrees in arbitrary order, could be empty |
