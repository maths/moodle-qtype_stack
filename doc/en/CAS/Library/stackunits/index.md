## NULLNUM<a id='NULLNUM'></a>

Special value signifying that there is no magnitude or value component
attached to a `stackunits`-object. Sometimes sensible to interpret as `1`.

Do not assign anything to this, but do feel free to evaluate expressions
with this having a value, e.g., `ev(...,NULLNUM=1)`.


---


## NULLUNITS<a id='NULLUNITS'></a>

Special value signifying that there is no dimension or unit component
attached to a `stackunits`-object. Basically, a dimensionless value.


---


## backtosibase(expression)<a id='backtosibase'></a>

Converts units to SI-base units. Useful for comparison of values with
different units.

*NOTE!* this is a legacy alias for [`stack_unit_si_to_si_base`](#stack_unit_si_to_si_base), which may be deprecated in future versions.



| Argument name | type | description |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| expression | expression | an expression with units mixed in or a singular `stackunits`-object. |




| Return type | description |
| ----------- | ------------|
| expression | an expression with units mixed in or a    `stackunits`-object, with all units converted to SI base units. |


---


## stack_unit_si_to_si_base(expression)<a id='stack_unit_si_to_si_base'></a>

Converts units to SI-base units. Useful for comparison of values with
different units.



| Argument name | type | description |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| expression | expression | an expression with units mixed in or a `stackunits`-object. |




| Return type | description |
| ----------- | ------------|
| expression | an expression with units mixed in or a    `stackunits`-object, with all units converted to SI base units. |

## stackunits(number,unit)<a id='stackunits(number,unit)'></a>

An object combining a numerical value to an unit forming a dimensional
quantity. Basically, a container keeping things together and allowing
presentational adjustments as well as handling of special cases like
`stackunits(0,kg)` where is very different from `0*kg`, the latter will
simply simplify away while the former does still maintain knowledge of
the unit.

Should you need to extract either part of the object, use the functions
`stack_units_nums` and `stack_units_units`.

See [`NULLUNITS`](#NULLUNITS) and [`NULLNUM`](#NULLNUM) for special identifiers used in special cases.



| Argument name | type | description |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| number | expression | the numeric magnitude of this pair, can also    we a presentational accuracy wrapper like `dispdp` or `dispsf` |
| unit | expression | expression consisting of unit representing    identifiers, e.g, `kV`, `m/s` or `kg/cm^3` |




| Return type | description |
| ----------- | ------------|
| stackbasen | returns itself, does not evaluate on its own |
