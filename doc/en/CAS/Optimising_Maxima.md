# Optimising Maxima

***NOT FULLY TESTED IN VERSION 3.0***

The instructions for both CLISP and SBCL have been tested and work in STACK 3, but it is not clear how much they actually shorten access times, if at all. SBCL was tested with Maxima version 5.23.2 and CLISP with some Maxima version. The instructions do *not* seem to work with Maxma 5.27 as of 28 May 2012.

There are several ways to reduce the access and execution time of this CAS which can prove useful for scaling.

## Compiled Lisp ##

[Maxima](../CAS/Maxima.md) can be run with a number of Lisp implementations.
Although CLISP is the most portable -- due to being interpreted -- other lisps can give faster execution.

[Maxima](../CAS/Maxima.md) can be compiled with one or more of 4 LISP implementations;
[CLISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLISP) , [CMUCL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMU_Common_Lisp),
GCL and SBCL. Of the four, CLISP is the most portable, but is also by far the slowest due to its being
the only LISP interpreter. Using [Maxima](../CAS/Maxima.md) compiled with CMUCL, GCL or SBCL will generally
give much better performance.

## Preloading ##

In STACK version 2, it was possible to decrease CAS access times by a significant factor via a [tip originally provided Niels
Walet](http://stack.bham.ac.uk/live/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=134) by preloading the STACK files.

### CLISP ###

The principle is to [save an image](http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/image.html) of Maxima running with STACK libraries already loaded then run this directly.  It
is fairly straightforward with the following steps.

* Check your Maxima Lisp with **maxima --list-avail** to see what Lisps you have to run Maxima.  We assume you have CLISP. Type **locate lisp.run** to find the
path(s) for the next step.
* Load Maxima, using switches for a particular version if you need, e.g. **maxima -l CLISP -u 5.19.2**.
* Within Maxima, type the following lines to create an image and exit.

~~~~
	load("<path>/maximalocal.mac");
	:lisp (ext:saveinitmem "maxima-clisp.mem" :init-function #'user::run)
	quit();
~~~~

* Modify configured CAS command in the moodle settings page to

~~~~~~
	"maxima-sbcl"; // was "maxima"
~~~~~~

* Comment out the last line of `moodledata/stack/maximalocal.mac`, i.e. to:

~~~~~
	/* load("stackmaxima.mac")$ */
~~~~~

Access speed increases of between 2 and 9.5 times have been reported over the standard CLISP configurations.
Applying this to compiled Lisp versions - such as CMUCL - is being investigated.

### SBCL ###

If you are using stack with sbcl (if you are using centos5/sl5/rhel5 with maxima from epel), use the following to generate a stand alone executable:

~~~~
	load("<path>/maximalocal.mac");
	:lisp (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "maxima-sbcl" :toplevel #'run :executable t)
~~~~

* Modify configured CAS command in the moodle settings page to

~~~~~~
	"maxima-sbcl"; // was "maxima"
~~~~~~

* Comment out the last line of `moodledata/stack/maximalocal.mac`, i.e. to:

~~~~~
	/* load("stackmaxima.mac")$ */
~~~~~

Note that

* the above commands should be typed one line at a time, without spaces.
* running the healthcheck script over writes `maximalocal.mac`

### Other Lisps ###

The following web pages have more information for a few types of lisp: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25046/lisp-executable> and

## Putting Maxima on other servers ##

It may be possible to place Maxima on a separate and dedicated server.  This may be desirable for many reasons, and may be combined with the optimization steps
above.  This is untested with STACK.
