# Maxima and computer algebra use in STACK

STACK uses the computer algebra system (CAS)
[Maxima](Maxima.md). We have also provided some background to
[CAS](CAS.md) in general.

Computer algebra systems are most often designed for either the
research mathematician, or the student _to do calculations_.
For the purposes of assessment our calculation _establish some
relevant properties_ of the students' answers.  Establishing
properties in this way, and on the basis of this creating
outcomes such as feedback, is something particular to
assessment systems. Such properties include things like

* is the expression algebraically equivalent to the correct answer?
* is the expression fully simplified?
* is the expression written a particular conventional form, (e.g. factored, partial fraction)?
* are all the numbers in the expression written as fractions in the lowest terms?

We assume a certain amount of knowledge about Maxima when writing STACK questions.

## Tutorials for STACK users  {#tutorial}

* Basic information on using [Maxima](Maxima.md) with STACK.

A graphical Maxima interface like [wxMaxima](http://andrejv.github.com/wxmaxima/) can also be very helpful for learning Maxima syntax and function names.

## Reference material on Maxima in STACK   {#reference}

Information on specific mathematical topics are found below

* [Predicate functions](Predicate_functions.md), which are useful to test expressions.
* [Randomly generated objects](Random.md).
* [Plots](Plots.md) and graphics.
* [Numbers](Numbers.md), including floating point and complex numbers.
* [Inequalities](Inequalities.md).
* [Matrices and vectors](Matrix.md).
* [Differential equations](Differential_equations.md).
* [Buggy rules](Buggy_rules.md) implenments rules which are not always valid!


## Developer information, and other topics {#developer}

* Setting up a [STACK-Maxima sandbox](STACK-Maxima_sandbox.md) for testing code on the desktop.
* [Optimising Maxima](Optimising_Maxima.md).
