# Development track for STACK 3.6 and STACK 4.0

Requests for features and ideas for developing STACK are all recorded in [Future plans](Future_plans.md). The
past development history is documented on [Development history](Development_history.md).

How to report bugs and make suggestions is described on the [community](../About/Community.md) page.

As of January 2016 there are two parallel development tracks for STACK.

# STACK 3.6

This track is developing more inputs, including a "reasoning by equivalence" input type.

# STACK 4.0

This track adds major new features, and changes the interaction model for STACK substantially.  The goal is to develop STACK 3.5 and STACK 4.0 in parallel.  At a point where both are stable we will decide whether to actually release 3.5, or to merge and release all features as one new major change.

* Expand the CASText format to enable us to embed the _value_ of a variable in CASText, not just the displayed form.
* Conditionals in CASText adaptive blocks. (Aalto) See [question blocks](../Authoring/Question_blocks.md) for our plans.
* Add state to the question model.
