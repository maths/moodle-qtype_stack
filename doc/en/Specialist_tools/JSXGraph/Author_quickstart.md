# Authoring your first JSXGraph question

The purpose of this document is to help you author your first question using JSXGraph question using JSXGraph as an input.

## Before we start

This document assumes you have worked through the following sections of the Author quick-start guide.

* [Authoring quick start 1](../../AbInitio/Authoring_quick_start_1.md): A basic question.
* [Authoring quick start 2](../../AbInitio/Authoring_quick_start_2.md): Question variables.
* [Authoring quick start 3](../../AbInitio/Authoring_quick_start_3.md): Improving feedback.

__We strongly recommend you do not use an HTML-aware editor when editing STACK questions containing JSXGraph.__  Instead turn off the editor within Moodle and edit the raw HTML.  Individual users can set their editor preferences by following:

    User Dashboard > Preferences > Editor preferences > Manage editors
