# JSXGraph

This page documents use of JSXGraph to display visuals. This is a somewhat advanced topic. For basic plots and visuals you may prefer to [use Maxima to plot graphs](../../CAS/Maxima_plot.md).

STACK supports inclusion of dynamic graphs using JSXGraph: [http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/).

Note, we strongly recommend you do not use an HTML-aware editor when using JSXGraph questions.  Instead turn off the editor within Moodle and edit the raw HTML.

    Site administration > Plugins > Text editors > Manage editors

Individual users can also set their editor preferences:

    User Dashboard > Preferences > Editor preferences > Manage editors

3. JSXGraph block: [reference documentation](Question_block.md)
4. Binding JSXGraph to inputs: [reference documentation](Binding.md)
   * simple binding
   * custom binding
   * [advanced custom binding](Advanced_JSXGraph.md)
5. 3D JSXGraph authoring example:
6. [Examples of interesting JSXGraph plots](Example_plots.md).
7. Using PRTs to [update a JSXGraph plot in the question](Update_with_PRTs.md).
