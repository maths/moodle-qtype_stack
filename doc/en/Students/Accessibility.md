# Accessibility

## How do I make the fonts bigger? ##

**Warning:** _do not change the size of the font while taking a quiz._

Navigate away from the quiz page first.  Sometimes the browser will "reload" the page when you change the font size, and this may cause your work to be submitted or lost!

The fonts which STACK uses should be able to scale.  Use the normal options on the browser to change the sizes of the fonts. This changes all the fonts on the page, including the mathematics.

## Other accessibility features ##

As part of Moodle, we are able to take advantage of the work done by that community, detailed [here](http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Accessibility).

The preferred route to displaying mathematics in STACK is to use MathJax.  Details of what accessibility features this support are given [here](http://www.mathjax.org/resources/articles-and-presentations/accessible-pages-with-mathjax/).

STACK itself uses very simple CSS and HTML form fields, which present very low barriers to accessibility software.
