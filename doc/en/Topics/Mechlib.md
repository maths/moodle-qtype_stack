# Meclib: supporting mechanical systems

Meclib is a project maintained by Martin Kraska providing a set of tools to simplify authoring of STACK questions with a focus on 
- JSXGraph based static and interactive illustrations controlled by Maxima lists (defined in the question variables)
- Maxima functions for rich formative feedback on interactive graphic input and on numeric or symbolic expressions.

The set of objects is created with sketches of mechanical systems in mind (support and load symbols, bars, ropes, disks, annotations). The most advanced application is the interactive creation of free body diagrams with rich formative feedback.

Documentation is maintained on a separate site: see [Mechlib Wiki](https://github.com/mkraska/meclib/wiki).
