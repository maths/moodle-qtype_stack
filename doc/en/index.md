Welcome to the official user documentation for the [STACK project](About/index.md).

STACK is an open-source system for computer-aided assessment in Mathematics and related disciplines, with emphasis on formative assessment.
This documentation is for STACK, which provides a question type for the Moodle quiz.
More about what we are trying to achieve can be found under [the philosophy of STACK](About/The_philosophy_of_STACK.md).
