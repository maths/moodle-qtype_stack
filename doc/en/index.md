STACK is the world-leading open-source (GPL) automatic assessment system for mathematics, science and related disciplines.

* Students type in mathematical expressions, and are not restricted to multiple choice.
* Separate _validation_ and _assessment_ with an emphasis on formative assessment.
* Random generation of questions.
* A wide variety of input types, including line by line working.
* Support for multipart questions.
