# A linux shell script for merging two overlapping translations.
# Usage is ./transmerge <input file 1> <input file 2> <output file>
# The output is a sorted translation files, where the string doubles
# are resolved by hand.

# Copy file headers from the first file into the target
grep -v \$string $1 > $3

# Copy the strings from both files and sort, save temporarily
grep \$string $1 | sort -- > transmerge_sorted1.php
grep \$string $2 | sort -- > transmerge_sorted2.php

# Merge the temp files and put the result in the target
sort transmerge_sorted1.php transmerge_sorted2.php >> $3

# Clean up temp files
rm -f transmerge_sorted1.php transmerge_sorted2.php
