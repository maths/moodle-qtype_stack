# Questions for the STACK demo site

This directory contains moodle .xml of STACK questions for the sample page on the API demo site.
(Prototype is currently http://172.16.49.108/sample.php and only available from within UoE.)

The name of the questions will be taken from the XML itself and displayed in the menu on the left. The order of the questions
in the menu will be the natural sort order of filenames. Add '10-', '15-', '20-' to the start of the file names to put them in the order you want.

Add styled text to the question text to explain the significance of the question and give its location in the STACK library. Use `<div class="stack-comment"> ... </div>` for these comments.


The names of the questions might need to be made more readable as well.
