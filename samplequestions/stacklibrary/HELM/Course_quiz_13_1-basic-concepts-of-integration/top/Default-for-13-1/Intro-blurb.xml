      <text><![CDATA[<h3><span>Basic Concepts of Integration</span><br></h3>

<p>When a function \(f(x)\) is known we can differentiate it to obtain its derivative \(\dfrac{df}{dx}\). The reverse process is to obtain the function \(f(x)\) from knowledge of its derivative. This process is called <strong>integration</strong>. Applications of integration are numerous and some of these will be explored in subsequent Sections. First, what is important is to practise basic techniques and learn a variety of methods for integrating functions.</p><br>]]></text>
