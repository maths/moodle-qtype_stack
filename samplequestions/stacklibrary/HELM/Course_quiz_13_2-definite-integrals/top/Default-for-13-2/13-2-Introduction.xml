      <text><![CDATA[<p>When you were first introduced to integration as the reverse of differentiation, the integrals you dealt with were <strong>indefinite integrals</strong>. The result of finding an indefinite integral is usually a function plus a constant of integration. In this Section we introduce <strong>definite integrals</strong>, so called because the result will be a definite answer, usually a number, with no constant of integration. Definite integrals have many applications, for example in finding areas bounded by curves, and finding volumes of solids.</p>]]></text>
