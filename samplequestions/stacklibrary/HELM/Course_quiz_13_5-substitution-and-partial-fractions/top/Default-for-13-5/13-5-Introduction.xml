      <text><![CDATA[<p>The first technique described here involves making a substitution to simplify an integral. We let a new variable equal a complicated part of the function we are trying to integrate. Choosing the correct substitution often requires experience. This skill develops with practice.</p>
<p> Often the technique of partial fractions can be used to write an algebraic fraction as the sum of simpler fractions. On occasions this means that we can then integrate a complicated algebraic fraction. We shall explore this approach in the second half of the section.</p>]]></text>
