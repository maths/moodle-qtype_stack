      <text><![CDATA[<h4>The alternating series&nbsp;test and ratio test</h4><p>The techniques we have applied to analyse the harmonic and the alternating harmonic series are
‘one-off’:- they cannot be applied to infinite series in general. However, there are many tests that
can be used to determine the convergence properties of many infinite series. Of the large number available
we shall only consider two such tests in detail, namely the ratio test and alternating series test.<br></p>]]></text>
