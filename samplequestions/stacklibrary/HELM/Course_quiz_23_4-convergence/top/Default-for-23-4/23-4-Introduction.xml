In this Section we examine, briefly, the convergence characteristics of a Fourier series. We have seen
that a Fourier series can be found for functions which are not necessarily continuous (there may be
<i>jumps</i> in the curve) - the only requirement that we have made is that the function be periodic. We
have seen that the more terms we take in the Fourier series the better is the approximation to the
given signal. But an obvious question to ask is <i>what happens at the points of discontinuity?</i> What
does the Fourier series converge to at these points? It must converge to something (finite) since a
Fourier series is a sum of very smooth continuous functions. In this Section we give the answer to
this question.]]></text>
