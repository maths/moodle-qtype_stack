<p>The distance between the points with coordinates \(A=(x_1, y_1)\) and \(B=(x_2,y_2)\) is given by the following formula.</p>

<div class="HELM_keypoint">
<h4>Key Point</h4>
<h5>Distance Between Two Points</h5>
<p>The distance between the two points \(A=(x_1, y_1)\) and \(B=(x_2, y_2)\), is given by:</p>
\[\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}.\]
</div>
<p>We can see this as a direct consequence of the theorem of Pythagoras. The distance between two points is the length of the straight line segment connecting them. This line segment is the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle with base \(|x_2-x_1|\) and height \(|y_2-y_1|\). It is a useful exercise to sketch this case so you understand how we calculate the length.</p>]]></text>
