    <questiontext format="html">
      <text><![CDATA[<h4>Subsets</h4><p>Sometimes one set is contained completely within another set.  For example, if \(X = \{2,3,4,5,6\} \hbox{ and } Y = \{2,3,6\}\), then all the elements of \(Y\) are also elements of \(X\).  We say that \(Y\) is a <b>subset</b> of \(X\) and write \(Y \subseteq X\).<br></p>

<h4 class="HELM_example">Example</h4>
<p>Given \(A = \{0,1,2,3\}\), \(B = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}\) and \(C = \{0,1\}\), state which sets are subsets.</p>
<h4 class="HELM_solution">Solution</h4>
<p>\(A\) is a subset of \(B\), that is \(A \subseteq B\).</p>
<p>\(C\) is a subset of \(B\), that is \(C \subseteq B\).</p>
<p>\(C\) is a subset of \(A\), that is \(C \subseteq A\).</p>]]></text>
