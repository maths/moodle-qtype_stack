      <text><![CDATA[<h4> Events </h4>
<p> As we have already noted a collection of some or all of the outcomes of an experiment is called an <strong>event</strong>. So an event is a <strong>subset</strong> of the sample space. For example, if we throw a 6-sided die then the sample space is \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) and two possible events are </p>
<ul>
<li> a score of 3 or more, represented by the set: \(\{3, 4, 5, 6\}\) </li>
<li> a score which is even, represented by the set: \(\{2, 4, 6\}\). </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="HELM_example"> Example </h4>
<p> Two coins are thrown. List the ordered outcomes for the event when just one Tail
is obtained. </p>
<h4 class="HELM_solution"> Solution </h4>
<p> \(\{HT, TH\}\). Note that here the <strong>order does matter</strong>, i.e. \(TH\) is distinct from \(HT\). </p>]]></text>
