      <text><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><ol><li>It is possible to draw a red picture card (e.g. Jack of hearts) meaning that events \(A\) and \(B\) are not mutually exclusive.</li><li>A participant is randomly assigned to either the placebo or the experimental treatment, never both. This means that events \(A\) and \(B\) are mutually exclusive.</li><li>As the box contains at least one of the three types if nuts, there is a non-zero probability of selecting one that is BSF and another that is metric. Therefore events \(A\) and \(B\) are not mutually exclusive.</li></ol></p>]]></text>
