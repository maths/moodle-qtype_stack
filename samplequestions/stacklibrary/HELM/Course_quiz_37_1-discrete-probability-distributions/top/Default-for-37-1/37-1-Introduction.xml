their associated random variables. Numerical random variables may be classified in two broad but
distinct categories called <em>discrete random variables</em> and <em>continuous random variables</em>. Often, discrete
random variables are associated with counting while continuous random variables are associated with
measuring. Generally speaking, discrete random variables can take values which are separate and can
be listed. Strictly speaking, the real situation is a little more complex but it is sufficient for our
purposes to equate the word discrete with a finite list. In contrast, continuous random variables
can take values anywhere within a specified range. This Section will familiarize you with the idea
of a discrete random variable and the associated probability distributions.<br><p></p>]]></text>
