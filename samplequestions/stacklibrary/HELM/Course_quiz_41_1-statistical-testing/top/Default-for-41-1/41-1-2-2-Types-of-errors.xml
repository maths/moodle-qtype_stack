      <text><![CDATA[<h3>Types of errors</h3>
<p>Since we cannot be 100% sure that a hypothesis is true or false it is possible that: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> a correct hypothesis will be rejected; </li>
      <li> a false hypothesis will be accepted. </li>
    </ol></p>

<p>Rejecting a correct hypothesis is called a Type I error and accepting a false hypothesis is called a Type II error.</p>
<p> By working in a logical manner and developing a set of rules or guide-lines, it is possible to minimise the occurrence of such errors.</p>
<p> This will introduce you to the basic ideas of hypothesis testing in a non-mathematical way by using a problem solving approach to highlight the concepts as they are needed.</p>
<p> Once you have learned how to apply the basic ideas, you will be capable of applying hypothesis testing to a very wide range of practical problems and learning about methods of hypothesis testing which are not covered in this Workbook.</p>]]></text>
