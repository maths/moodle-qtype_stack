<p>We can apply the same process as above to factorise a general quadratic. Recall that the standard form of a quadratic is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). In this case, we need to find two numbers which multiply to get \(ac\) and sum to get \(b\). That is, we need to find \(m, n\) such that 
\[
m \cdot n = a\cdot c \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad m+ n = b.
\]
Then the process follows in the same way as the previous example. We will look at this in more detail in the next section.</p>]]></text>
