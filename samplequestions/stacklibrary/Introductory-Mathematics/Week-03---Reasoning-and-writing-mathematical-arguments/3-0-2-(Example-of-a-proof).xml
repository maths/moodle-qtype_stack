      <text><![CDATA[<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Alice, Bob and Clarissa are involved at a meeting. Alice looks at Bob and Bob looks at Clarissa. Alice is married but Clarissa is not.</p> 
<p>Is Bob married?</p>
<p>Prove that a married person looks at an unmarried one.</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>We do not know if Bob is married or unmarried. Therefore we have to consider both cases in our proof.</p>

<p><b>Proof:</b></p>
<p>Note that either Bob is married or unmarried, so there are two cases.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bob is married: In this case then when Bob looks at Clarissa a married person is looking at an unmarried one.</li>
<li>Bob is unmarried: In this case when Alice looks at Bob  a married person is looking at an unmarried one.</li>
</ol>

<p>In both cases a married person is looking at an unmarried one therefore a married person always looks at an unmarried one.</p>]]></text>
