      <text><![CDATA[<h1>Mathematical Fallacy</h1>

<p>Sometimes, doing mathematics can lead to certain kinds of mistaken proof, that is proofs which look correct but actually contain an error in either logic or calculation. These are illustrations of <b>mathematical fallacy</b>. There is a difference between a mathematical fallacy and a simple mistake. A mathematical fallacy is so called because it contains some element of concealment or deception in the presentation of the proof. For example, this may be a division by zero which is hidden simply by algebraic notation. In the rest of this section we will examine some common mathematical fallacies.</p>]]></text>
