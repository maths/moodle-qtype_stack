      <text><![CDATA[<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Amelia and Bob are shopping in a bike store, which sells both ordinary bikes and quad-bikes. Amelia observes that there are \(20\) bikes in total and Bob notes that there are \(46\) wheels in total Suppose that there are \(x\) ordinary bikes and \(y\) quad bikes. Write equations to encode this information.</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>We have that there are \(x\) ordinary bikes and \(y\) quad bikes. From Amelia's observation we have that the number of ordinary and quad bikes is twenty, therefore \(x+y = 20\).</p>
<p>From Bob's observation that there are \(46\) wheels in total we have that \(2x + 4y = 46\). Thus the equations that encode this information are
\[
\begin{align*}
&x+y = 20
\\
&2x+4y = 46.
\end{align*}
\]</p>
<br/>
<p>Is this possible or have Amelia and Bob made an error? We will see how to answer questions of this type in the next section.</p>]]></text>
