      <text><![CDATA[<h3>Matrix size</h3>

<p>Matrices can be of any size as long as the entries form a rectangular array. We say that an <b>\(m \times n\)</b> matrix is a matrix with \(m\) rows and \(n\) columns. For example
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 
\\
3 & 4
\\
5& 6
\end{bmatrix}
\]
is a \(3 \times 2\) matrix because it has three rows and two columns. A matrix which has a size of \(1 \times n\) is called a <b>row vector</b> because it is a matrix consisting of one row. Similarly, a matrix of size \(n \times 1\) is called a <b>column vector</b> because it is a matrix consisting of one column. The entries of a matrix are called the <b>elements</b> of the matrix, most often these will be numbers.<p>
<br/>
<p>A matrix that has the same number of rows as columns is called a <b>square matrix</b>, these are one of the most important types of matrices.</p>]]></text>
