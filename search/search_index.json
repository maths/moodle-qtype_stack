In particular, the colon <code>:</code> is used to assign a value to a variable.  So to assign the value of <code>5</code> to <code>a1</code>, we use the syntax <code>a1:5</code>. In general, it is good practice to give variables multi-character names, as single-character names are meant for student input. This is because multi-character variables the author defined cannot by default be input by students. Additionally, adding semicolons to the end of each line is optional, but good practice.</p> <p>Notice we are using the CAS to determine the model answer by calling the <code>int()</code> function to find the anti-derivative.

You then specify what the expected outcome is for that input, namely the score, penalty and answer note you expect to land on. Recall from the last part that the <code>Answer note</code> is the name for a specific outcome on a potential response tree.</p> <p>The penalty is a number deducted from the total mark for each incorrect attempt the student has. By default, it is set to 0.1. You can change the penalty in the <code>General section</code> under <code>Penalty</code>. Note that this feature is only used in the question behaviours <code>Interactive with multiple tries</code> and <code>Adaptive mode</code>, as they are the only ones that allow multiple attempts. We will discuss question behaviours in a later part. </p> <p>Fill in the following information for your first test case:</p> <pre><code>ans1 = ta\nscore = 1\npenalty = 0\nanswernote = prt1-2-T\n</code></pre> <p>I.e., if the student puts in the model answer they should pass the first node (checks if they have integrated correctly) and pass the second node (tests that their answer is factored) and end up with a score of 1 and no penalty. </p> <p>Note that the input is evaluated before the test is conducted. Students are not allowed to enter the variable  <code>ta</code> because it is a teacher-defined variable, however the evaluated form, fx.  <code>-1*(x-1)^(-3)+c</code>, is an allowed input. For each test case, you can see the un-evaluated input under <code>Test input</code>, and the actual input tested under <code>Value entered</code>. </p> <p>You can run the test on all deployed versions by clicking on  <code>Run all tests on all deployed variants</code> .</p> <p>You can add as many tests as you think is needed, and it is usually a sensible idea to add one for each case you anticipate.

In this case STACK should fail to give students any marks, indicating the test passes!</p> <p>You should also use question tests to check that solving every variant requires the competences that you desire. For example, in this question we want students to know (1) increase the power by 1 and (2) divide by the new power. They should not be able to get away with, for example, increasing the power and multiplying by the new power. Let's add a test case to check this.</p> <pre><code>ans1 = (a1*(-nn+1))*(x-a2)^(-nn+1)+c\nscore = 0\npenalty = 0.1\nanswernote = prt1-F\n</code></pre> <p>We are testing that if we multiply by  instead of dividing, we should be given a score of 0. If students are required this knowledge for all variants, then all variants should pass this test. Click  <code>Run all tests on all deployed variants</code> to check this. </p> <p>You will see that not all deployed versions pass all tests, and if you click on a variant that failed a test, you will see why! Essentially, when nn=2, -nn+1=-1 multiplication and division are equivalent. Essentially, these random variants are \"easier\" than the others. This illustrates another key use of question tests - ensuring that all variants are the same difficulty and test the knowledge they are supposed to. In light of this, you may want to change <code>nn</code> again to <code>3+rand(4)</code> .

Students interact with \"inputs\" and the system establishes properties of these inputs with response trees. The response trees automatically execute when each non-empty input is \"valid\".  The introduction of (i) formative potential response trees, and particularly (ii) the <code>allowempty</code> option for inputs has expanded this model.</p> <p>For example, the <code>allowempty</code> option is a property of an input and not a response tree.  It is not possible to specify in the input settings that one response tree will allow an input to be empty, but another one will not.  There are some advanced use-cases with multiple response trees (perhaps some formative) which need more control over when the PRT is executed.</p> <p>For this reason it is sometimes helpful to allow pre-processing in the feedback variables to halt the execution of a particular potential response tree.  Halting and \"bailing out\" is similar to deciding an input is blank/invalid.  Scores are not updated, feedback is not generated, etc.  This \"attempt\" does not attract a penalty within the penalty system.</p> <p>STACK provides a special constant <code>%stack_prt_stop_p</code>.  By default this is set to <code>false</code> at the start of the feedback variables for each PRT.  If this evaluates to the boolean <code>true</code> at the end of the feedback variables then the response tree will not execute and the process will \"bail out\".</p> <p>For example, you could add the following to the feedback variables check if <code>ans1</code> is empty.</p> <pre><code>%stack_prt_stop_p:if is(ans1=EMPTYANSWER) then true else false;\n</code></pre> <p>(Note, different inputs indicate empty answers in different ways.

This is to make sure the type of an empty answer matches the type of the answer in a regular input.)</p> <p>Once the PRT has started there is no way to \"bail out\", or disregard the results of the tree. The decision must be made within the feedback variables.  (If you have a compelling use-case to add this option please contact the developers.)</p> <p>The PRT will return a note <code>prt1-bail</code> to indicate the tree attempted to execute but then stopped and \"bailed out\".

Ultimately we only compare parse trees exactly, and so we need to order terms in sums and products (commutativity). However y-x is never ordered as -x+y.  Furthermore, -(x-y) \\neq -x+y.  We need to factor out the unary minus and ensure that the coefficient of the leading term is not negative. Factoring out is better than distributing here, since in a produce such as -(x-y)(x-z) it is not clear which term in the product the initial minus sign will end up in. Since <code>negOrd</code> is a factor command, it is incompatible with <code>negDist</code>.</li> <li>Note that <code>oneDiv</code> only operates on the very special case of a single 1 in the denominator of a fraction.

If you choose the <code>nonmulCom</code> rule then you can switch off commutativity of multiplication.  However, rules such as <code>zeroMul</code> include both 0\\times x \\rightarrow 0 and x\\times 0 \\rightarrow 0.  The rules <code>intMul</code> (etc) would appear to be non-compatible with <code>nonmulCom</code>, however they are very useful in that by performing integer arithmetic we bring integers to the front of the expression.</p> <p>For convenience sets of rules can be specified.  E.g. you can use the name <code>ID_TRANS</code> in place of the list <code>[zeroAdd,zeroMul,oneMul,oneDiv,onePow,idPow,zeroPow,zPow]</code> to include all of the basic identity operators.</p> <p>If you want to remove tests from a list you can use code such as <code>delete(zeroAdd, ID_TRANS)</code>.</p> <p>The test takes the student's answer and teacher's answer and repeatedly applies the rules in turn until the expressions remain the same.

It is essential that the rules, and any combination of the rules, can only proceed in a single direction and that no infinite loops are created.  So, <code>intAdd</code> is fine because adding together two integers will make an expression simpler which in this case is shorter.  For this reason we do not have expanding out (i.e. distribution) rules in the above set, and no rules of indices (which readily lead to mathematical errors).  Use Maxima's simplifier if you want to include such rules.</p> <p>STACK creates parallel operators for <code>*</code>, <code>+</code> etc. so that we have full control over the simplifier and the rules in play.  E.g. <code>nounadd</code> instead of <code>+</code>.</p> <p>You can use <code>equals_commute_prepare(ex)</code> to change an expression into this noun form.  An optional second argument <code>equals_commute_prepare(ex, sc)</code> is the set of operators considered commutative, e.g. typically a subset of <code>{\"nouneq\", \"nounand\", \"nounor\", \"nounset\", \"nounadd\", \"nounmul\"}</code>.</p> <p>The simplifier rules assume <code>simp:false</code> and that the expression has noun forms. The simplifier rule names are Maxima functions with exactly the names shown above. Each rule has a predicate function, which decides if the rule can be applied at the top level of the expression.  E.g. <code>oneMulp(1*x)</code> is true, but <code>oneMulp(2+(1*x))</code> is false because the <code>1*x</code> is not at the top level of the expression <code>2+(1*x)</code>, it's deeper within the expression.</p> <p>To deal with unary minus we transform it into multiplication with a special tag <code>UNARY_MINUS</code>. For example <code>-x</code> becomes <code>UNARY_MINUS * x</code>.  This approach looks odd at first, but does not confuse <code>UNARY_MINUS</code> with the integer -1 or the unary function \"minus\".  In this way multiple unary minus operations commute to the front of an expression.  E.g. <code>(-x)*(-y) = UNARY_MINUS * UNARY_MINUS * x * y</code> (when <code>*</code> is assumed to be commutative and associative, of course!)</p> <p>Similarly, division is also conveted to <code>UNARY_RECIP</code>.  E.g. <code>(-x)/(-y) = UNARY_MINUS nounmul UNARY_RECIP(UNARY_MINUS nounmul y) nounmul x</code>.</p> <p>We the use the rule <code>negDiv</code> to pull out the unary minus outside the devision (pulls <code>UNARY_MINUS</code> outside <code>UNARY_RECIP</code>), but we also need the rules <code>assMul</code> (associativity) and <code>comMul</code> (commutativity).  E.g. try the following in the STACK-maxima sandbox.</p> <pre><code>ex:(-x)/(-y);\nex:equals_commute_prepare(ex);\ntransl(ex,[assMul, comMul, negDiv]);\n</code></pre> <p>This results in <code>UNARY_MINUS nounmul UNARY_MINUS nounmul x nounmul UNARY_RECIP(y)</code>, literally <code>- * - * x * 1/y</code>.   We could also include the rule <code>negNeg</code> to remove the double minus.</p> <pre><code>transl(ex,[assMul, comMul, negDiv, negNeg]);\n</code></pre> <p>gives <code>x nounmul UNARY_RECIP(y)</code>.</p> <p>The goal of this code is to create reliable equivalence classes of expressions.

Students sometimes use floating-point numbers when they should use fractions.  This option prevents problems with approximations being used.</p> <p>The typical problem is that students type in an expression such as <code>0.5x^2+0.33</code> then they mean to type in <code>1/2*x^2+1/3</code>. Mathematically,  exactly.  Indeed, any real number with a terminating decimal can be written exactly as a floating point number.  However, with <code>0.33</code> we cannot be sure if the student meant to type in \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{33}{100} or something else.</p> <p>In pure mathematics, when the teacher typically wants an exact answer, the most reliable option is to forbid floating point numbers with instant validation.  Students get immediate feedback, and are unlikely to be penalised on a technicality. From experience we strongly recommend validation to forbid floats in this situation, rather than trying to decide if a student's particular float is exact (as is <code>0.5</code>).</p> <p>STACK can, of course, establish that two numbers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are identical, in the sense that if <code>b</code> is a rational number with a terminating decimal then <code>a</code> is equivalent to <code>b</code> regardless of whether <code>a</code> is written as a float or not.  If <code>b</code> is a rational number without a terminating decimals (when primes other than 2 or 5 appear in the denominator of <code>b</code>) and <code>a</code> is a float then they are considered different since <code>a</code> is necessarily terminating.  (We have no notation to indicate a recurring float as input.) This means that, when establishing if a float is exact rational, looking at a number <code>a</code> in isolatation is insufficient. We have to match up <code>a</code> with a corresponding <code>b</code> to decide if <code>a</code> is potentially a terminating decimal equivalent to <code>b</code>.</p> <p>In order to match up corresponding parts of two expressions (e.g. the student's answer with the teacher's answer) to decide whether the use by a stuent of a float is exact, we need to start making assumptions about the form of the student's answer.  This creates fragility, e.g. if a student types in <code>x^2+2/3*x+1+0.5*x</code> then without simplification we have two terms with <code>x</code>.  With simpliciation, Maxima rewrites this as <code>x^2+1.166666666666667*x+1</code>, whereas the exact value is  <code>x^2+7/6*x+1</code>.  We have no commands to return <code>2/3+0.5</code> (unsimplified) as the coefficient (note Maxima's <code>coeff</code> command essentially requires <code>simp:true</code> to work correctly).</p> <p>Please note that some mathematicians use floats to denote a real numbwer with significant figures.  For example <code>0.33</code> is taken to be some real number 0.325 \\leq x \\le 0335.  For this situation it is not, of course, appopritate to equate 0.5 with \\frac{1}{2} as the two notations are conciously chosen for different purposes.</p>"},{"location":"en/Authoring/Inputs/#Require_lowest_terms","title":"Require lowest terms","text":"<p>When this option is set to <code>yes</code>, any coefficients or other rational numbers in an expression, must be written in lowest terms.

In this respect, this input type is unique, and the \"model answer\" field does not contain just the teacher's model answer.

New users are advised to gain confidence writing questions with algebraic inputs first, and gain experience in using Maxima lists.</p> <p>The \"model answer\" must be supplied in a particular form as a list of lists <code>[[value, correct(, display)], ... ]</code>.</p> <ul> <li><code>value</code> is the value of the teacher's answer.</li> <li><code>correct</code> must be either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.

This can be a string value here, but it will be passed through the CAS if you choose the LaTeX display option below.  <code>display</code> is only used in constructing the question.  STACK will take <code>value</code> as the student's answer internally, regardless of what is set here.</li> </ul> <p>For example</p> <pre><code> ta:[[diff(p,x),true],[p,false],[int(p,x),false]]\n</code></pre> <p>At least one of the choices must be considered <code>correct</code>.  However, the <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> values are only used to construct the \"teacher's correct answer\".   You must still use a potential response tree to assess the student's answer as normal.</p> <p>Note the <code>value</code> expression must be constructed with noun functions where a noun alternative exists.  E.g. use <code>%union()</code> (the noun form) not <code>union()</code>.  STACK has to match up what the student selects, and this is an expression they might well type into an algebraic input.  In this situation functions in students' expressions are turned to noun forms.  Hence the teacher must also use noun forms in setting up the MCQ input options.</p> <p>STACK provides some helper functions</p> <ol> <li><code>mcq_correct(ta)</code> takes the \"model answer\" list and returns a list of values for which <code>correct</code> is true.</li> <li><code>mcq_incorrect(ta)</code> takes the \"model answer\" list and returns a list of values for which <code>correct</code> is false.</li> </ol> <p>Note, that the optional <code>display</code> field is only used when constructing the choices seen by the student when displaying the question.  The student's answer will be the <code>value</code>, and this value is normally displayed to the student using the validation feedback, i.e. \"Your last answer was interpreted as...\". A fundamental design principal of STACK is that the student's answer should be a mathematical expression, and this input type is no exception.</p> <p>In situations where there is a significant difference between the optional <code>display</code> and the <code>value</code> which would be confusing, the only current option is to turn off validation feedback.  After all, this should not be needed anyway with this input type.  In the example above when a student is asked to choose the right method the <code>value</code> could be an integer and the display is some kind of string.</p> <p>An example which includes the <code>display</code> option is</p> <pre><code>tacp:[[A, false, \"A. Direct proof\"],  [B, false, \"B. Definition-chasing\"], [C, false, \"C. If and only if\"], [D, false, \"D. Exhaustive cases\"], [E, false, \"E. Induction\"], [F, false, \"F. Contrapositive\"], [G, true, \"G. Contradiction\"]];\n</code></pre> <p>Note in this example the <code>value</code> of the student's answer will be a letter which is literally a Maxima variable name.  In this situation you can't really randomize the letters used easily.  (Not impossible with some cunning code, but a lot of work....)</p> <p>When using checkbox or radio input types, the <code>display</code> value can include LaTeX code. (See below for including mathematics in a drop down input type.) Any <code>\\</code> in the LaTeX code needs to be escaped to <code>\\\\</code>. For example a model answer might be</p> <pre><code> tacp:[[0, true, \"\\\\( \\\\sin(x) \\\\)\"], [1, false, \"\\\\( \\\\cos(x) \\\\)\"], [2, false, \"\\\\( e^x \\\\)\"]]\n</code></pre> <p>If you choose to use an integer, and randomly shuffle the answers then the validation feedback would be confusing, since an integer (which might be shuffled) has no correspondence to the choices selected.  This behaviour is a design decision and not a bug! It may change in the future if there is sufficient demand, but it requires a significant change in STACK's internals to have parallel \"real answer\" and \"indicated answer\". Such a change might have other unintended and confusing consequences.</p> <p>Normally we don't permit duplicate values in the values of the teacher's answer.  If the input type receives duplicate values STACK will throw an error.  This probably arises from poor randomization.  However it may be needed.  If duplicate entries are permitted use the display option to create unique value keys with the same display. This behaviour is a design decision may change in the future.</p> <p>When STACK displays the \"teacher's answer\", e.g. after a quiz is due, this will be constructed from the <code>display</code> fields corresponding to those elements for which <code>correct</code> is <code>true</code>.  I.e. the \"teacher's answer\" will be a list of things which the student could actually select.  Whether the student is able to select more than one, or if more than one is actually included, is not checked.  The teacher must indicate at least one choice as <code>true</code>.</p> <p>If you need \"none of these\" you must include this as an explicit option, and not rely on the student not checking any boxes in the checkbox type.

Assume we have a function f(g(x)), then defining u=g(x), the derivative with respect to x is given by: \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f(g(x))}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}g(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\cdot\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f(u)}{\\mathrm{d}u}. Alternatively, we can write: \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x} = f'(g(x))\\cdot g'(x). </p>"},{"location":"en/Authoring/Question_blocks/Fact_sheets/#standard-integrals","title":"Standard Integrals","text":"<p><code>[[facts:calc_int_standard_integrals]]</code></p> <p>\\[\\int k\\ \\mathrm{d}x = kx +c, \\text{ where } k \\text{ is constant.}\\] \\[\\int x^n\\ \\mathrm{d}x  = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+c, \\quad (n\\ne -1)\\] \\[\\int x^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{d}x = \\int {\\frac{1}{x}}\\ \\mathrm{d}x = \\ln(|x|)+c = \\ln(k|x|)\\]</p> \\(f(x)\\) \\(\\int f(x)\\ \\mathrm{d}x\\) \\(e^x\\) \\(e^x+c\\) \\(\\cos(x)\\) \\(\\sin(x)+c\\) \\(\\sin(x)\\) \\(-\\cos(x)+c\\) \\(\\tan(x)\\) \\(\\ln(\\sec(x))+c\\) \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2} &lt; x &lt; \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) \\(\\sec x\\) \\(\\ln (\\sec(x)+\\tan(x))+c\\) \\( -{\\pi\\over 2}&lt; x &lt; {\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\) \\(\\text{cosec}(x)\\) \\(\\ln (\\text{cose}c(x)-\\cot(x))+c\\quad\\) \\(0 &lt; x &lt; \\pi\\) cot(\\x\\) \\(\\ln(\\sin(x))+c\\) \\(0&lt; x&lt; \\pi\\) \\(\\cosh(x)\\) \\(\\sinh(x)+c\\) \\(\\sinh(x)\\) \\(\\cosh(x) + c\\) \\(\\tanh(x)\\) \\(\\ln(\\cosh(x))+c\\) \\(\\text{coth}(x)\\) \\(\\ln(\\sinh(x))+c \\) \\(x&gt;0\\) \\({1\\over x^2+a^2}\\) \\({1\\over a}\\tan^{-1}{x\\over a}+c\\) \\(a&gt;0\\) \\({1\\over x^2-a^2}\\) \\({1\\over 2a}\\ln{x-a\\over x+a}+c\\) \\(x &gt; a &gt;0\\) \\({1\\over a^2-x^2}\\) \\({1\\over 2a}\\ln{a+x\\over a-x}+c\\) \\(a &gt; x &gt;0\\) \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^2+a^2}}\\) \\(\\sinh^{-1}\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) + c\\) \\(a&gt;0\\) \\({1\\over \\sqrt{x^2-a^2}}\\) \\(\\cosh^{-1}\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) + c\\) \\(x\\geq a &gt; 0\\) \\({1\\over \\sqrt{x^2+k}}\\) \\(\\ln (x+\\sqrt{x^2+k})+c\\) \\({1\\over \\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}\\) \\(\\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)+c\\) \\(-a\\leq x\\leq a\\)"},{"location":"en/Authoring/Question_blocks/Fact_sheets/#the-linearity-rule-for-integration","title":"The Linearity Rule for Integration","text":"<p><code>[[facts:calc_int_linearity_rule]]</code></p> <p> \\int \\left(af(x)+bg(x)\\right)\\mathrm{d}x = a\\int\\!\\!f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\,+\\,b\\int \\!\\!g(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x, \\quad (a,b \\, \\, {\\rm constant.})  </p>"},{"location":"en/Authoring/Question_blocks/Fact_sheets/#integration-by-substitution","title":"Integration by Substitution","text":"<p><code>[[facts:calc_int_methods_substitution]]</code></p> <p>  \\int f(u){\\mathrm{d}u\\over \\mathrm{d}x}\\mathrm{d}x=\\int f(u)\\mathrm{d}u \\quad\\hbox{and}\\quad \\int_a^bf(u){\\mathrm{d}u\\over \\mathrm{d}x}\\,{\\rm d}x = \\int_{u(a)}^{u(b)}f(u)\\mathrm{d}u.  </p>"},{"location":"en/Authoring/Question_blocks/Fact_sheets/#integration-by-parts","title":"Integration by Parts","text":"<p><code>[[facts:calc_int_methods_parts]]</code></p> <p>  \\int_a^b u{\\mathrm{d}v\\over \\mathrm{d}x}\\mathrm{d}x=\\left[uv\\right]_a^b- \\int_a^b{\\mathrm{d}u\\over \\mathrm{d}x}v\\,\\mathrm{d}x or alternatively: \\int_a^bf(x)g(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x=\\left[f(x)\\,\\int g(x)\\mathrm{d}x\\right]_a^b -\\int_a^b{\\mathrm{d}f\\over {\\rm d}x}\\left\\{\\int g(x)\\mathrm{d}x\\right\\}\\mathrm{d}x. </p>"},{"location":"en/Authoring/Question_blocks/Fact_sheets/#integration-by-parts_1","title":"Integration by Parts","text":"<p><code>[[facts:calc_int_methods_parts_indefinite]]</code></p> <p>  \\int u{\\mathrm{d}v\\over \\mathrm{d}x}\\mathrm{d}x=uv- \\int{\\mathrm{d}u\\over \\mathrm{d}x}v\\,\\mathrm{d}x or alternatively: \\int f(x)g(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x=f(x)\\,\\int g(x)\\mathrm{d}x -\\int {\\mathrm{d}f\\over \\mathrm{d}x}\\left\\{\\int g(x)\\mathrm{d}x\\right\\}\\mathrm{d}x. </p>"},{"location":"en/Authoring/Question_blocks/Iframe_blocks/","title":"Iframe blocks","text":"<p>The iframe block is the basis for most dynamic blocks, with it one can construct a sandboxed iframe container within the question text and define freely what it contains.

Templates are essentially a way for handling repetition when <code>[[foreach]]</code> does not easily work or when inline CASText based function solutions are inconvenient. While inline CASText is often better it might not work as well as overridable templates when working with libraries.</p> <p>The template block has two parameters, the first being a name which should be a valid name for a function and the second being the mode parameter that controls the blocks behaviour and is of use especially for library builders. There are three different ways for using this block:</p> <ol> <li>To define a templates value for a given name one simply wraps that value in this block with that name. <code>[[template name=\"foobar\"]]Whatever is {@whatever@}[[/template]]</code>. This will not output anything and can also be done in inline CASText either in the question-variables to effect the whole question or in feedback-variables to effect PRTs.</li> <li>To output that template, one simply uses the empty block form <code>[[template name=\"foobar\"/]]</code> which will output whatever has been defined as that templates value or a warning about the template not been defined. One can add a mode parameter <code>mode=\"ignore missing\"</code> to not see that warning. Typically, one will use the <code>[[define/]]</code> block to change the values used within the template.</li> <li>For library makers the most common operation mode is the <code>mode=\"default\"</code> where the contents of the block are used if no overriding definition can be found. The default value will not define a default template and this intentional, if a template is to be shared then it needs to be defined at a global level where it always gets evaluated while default templates tend to be sensible to use even in conditionally evaluated contexts. Basically, if your library has any CASText that could benefit from being overridden you simply give it a name and wrap it with <code>[[template name=\"libarary_xyz\" mode=\"default\"]]...[[/template]]</code> and then maybe document somewhere that this name has this default where these injectable variables have these roles so that people may replace the wording and structure and still use the same values.</li> </ol> <p>Note in the background templates are just functions with CASText values. You can do the same with inline CASText and more importantly building your own functions allows you to use arguments for them and thus makes repetition with varying parameters simpler.

For example, <code>display_complex(1+2*%i/sqrt(2))</code> is displayed as 1+\\sqrt{2}\\,\\mathrm{i}.  If you really want 1+\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}\\,\\mathrm{i} then you will need to use the non-simplifying alternative below.  This function respects normal conventions, e.g. when <code>realpart</code> returns zero this function will not print 0+2\\,\\mathrm{i}, it just prints 2\\,\\mathrm{i}, etc.</li> <li><code>disp_complex(a, b)</code> assumes <code>a</code> is the real part and <code>b</code> is the imaginary part (no checking is done).  This function (mostly) does not simplify its arguments.  So <code>disp_complex(0, 2)</code> will appear as 0+2\\,\\mathrm{i}; <code>disp_complex(2/4, 1)</code> will appear as \\frac{2}{4}+1\\,\\mathrm{i}; and <code>disp_complex(2, 2/sqrt(2))</code> will appear as 2+\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}\\,\\mathrm{i}.  Use the atom <code>null</code> if you do not want to print a zero for the real part, or print one times the imaginary part.  <code>disp_complex(null, 2)</code> will appear as 2\\,\\mathrm{i} and <code>disp_complex(null, null)</code> will appear as just \\mathrm{i}.  Think of <code>null</code> as a non-printable unit (additive or multiplicative).</li> </ol> <p>There is one exception.  In order to pull out a unary minus to the front, <code>disp_complex(a, b)</code> will simplify <code>b</code> if <code>b</code> is not a number and it contains a unary minus.  So, for example <code>disp_complex(a, (-b^2)/b)</code> is displayed a-\\mathrm{i}\\,b.  (We might be able to fix this but this edge case requires disproportionate effort: ask the developers if this is essential).</p> <p>You cannot use these functions to display complex numbers in this form \\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2}, both these function will always display as \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathrm{i}.</p> <p>Display respects the multiplication sign used elsewhere within expressions, so that you may have \\frac{2\\cdot \\pi}{3}\\,\\mathrm{i} rather than \\frac{2\\, \\pi}{3}\\,\\mathrm{i}.</p> <p>Note that the function <code>display_complex(ex)</code> returns the inert form <code>disp_complex(a, b)</code>.  The expression <code>disp_complex(a, b)</code> is an \"inert form\", which is only used to fine-tune the display.  This function is not actually defined and so Maxima always returns it unevaluated.  To remove the inert form from an expression, which is needed to manipulate this further, use <code>remove_disp_complex</code>, e.g., with the following.</p> <pre><code>p1:disp_complex(a, b);\np2:ev(p1, disp_complex=remove_disp_complex);\n</code></pre> <p>(Because <code>null</code> has two different meanings within an expression it isn't sufficient to just define <code>disp_complex(ex1, ex2) := ex1+ex2*%i</code>.)</p> <p>There are occasions when you will need to explicitly add brackets to the displayed form of a complex number, e.g. to emphasise it is a single entity.  To add brackets there is a further \"inert form\" <code>disp_parens</code> which does nothing but add parentheses when the expression is displayed with the <code>tex()</code> function.  For example,</p> <pre><code>p1:disp_parens(display_complex(1+%i))*x^2+disp_parens(display_complex(1-%i));\n</code></pre> <p>will display as \\left( 1+\\mathrm{i} \\right)\\cdot x^2+\\left( 1-\\mathrm{i} \\right).  To remove these inert forms evaluate</p> <pre><code>p2:ev(p1, disp_complex=remove_disp_complex, disp_parens=lambda([ex],ex));\n</code></pre> <p>You must remove inert forms before expressions are evaluated by the potential response tree, for example in the feedback variables.

Note, the product of these factors may not be the original expression, and may differ by a factor of \\pm 1 due to unary minus extraction and ordering of variables.  For this reason, if you want to decide if <code>f1</code> is a factor of <code>ex</code> then it's better to check <code>remainder(ex,f1)</code> is zero, than membership of the factor list.  E.g. both <code>remainder(a^2-b^2,b-a)</code> and <code>remainder(a^2-b^2,a-b)</code> are zero, but <code>factorlist(a^2-b^2)</code> gives <code>[b-a,b+a]</code> which does not contain <code>a-b</code> as a factor. By default, the list does not contain multiplicities. If the list should contain multiplicities, use factorlist(ex, true). <code>zip_with(f,a,b)</code> This function applies the binary function f to two lists a and b returning a list. <code>zip_with_matrix(f,A,B)</code> This function applies the binary function f to two matrices A and B returning a matrix.  An example is given in adding matrices to show working. <code>coeff_list_nz(ex,v)</code> This function takes an expression <code>ex</code> and returns a list of nonzero coefficients of <code>v</code>. <code>divthru(ex)</code> Takes an algebraic fraction, e.g. (x^4-1)/(x+2) and divides through by the denominator, to leave a polynomial and a proper fraction. Useful in feedback, or steps of a calculation. <code>stack_strip_percent(ex,var)</code> Removes any variable beginning with the <code>%</code> character from <code>ex</code> and replace them with variables from <code>var</code>.  Useful for use with solve, ode2 etc.  Solve and ode2. <code>exdowncase(ex)</code> Takes the expression <code>ex</code> and substitutes all variables for their lower case version (cf <code>sdowncase(ex)</code> in Maxima).  This is very useful if you don't care if a student uses the wrong case, just apply this function to their answer before using an answer test.  Note, of course, that <code>exdowncase(X)-x=0.</code> <code>stack_reset_vars</code> Resets constants, e.g. i, as abstract symbols, see Numbers. <code>safe_op(ex)</code> Returns the operation of the expression as a string.  Atoms return an empty string (rather than throwing an error as does <code>op</code>). <code>comp_square(ex,v)</code> Returns a quadratic <code>ex</code> in the variable <code>v</code> in completed square form. <code>degree(ex,v)</code> Returns the degree of the expanded form of <code>ex</code> in the variable <code>v</code>.

While nested <code>disp_select</code> are possible (and will display multiple underlines: another reason for having underline) this particular function stops once <code>p1</code> is true.  You will need to build nested display by hand.</p> <p>For example, to select all the integers in an expression you can use the predicate <code>integerp</code> and <code>select(integerp, 1+x+0.5*x^2)</code> gives \\color{red}{\\underline{1}}+x+0.5\\cdot x^{\\color{red}{\\underline{2}}}.</p> <p>It is possible to use any of the existing predicate functions, or to define your own function in the question variables.</p> <p>The function <code>select_apply(f1, ex)</code> traverses the expression and when it encounters the <code>disp_select</code> function it applied the function <code>f1</code> to that sub-tree of the expression.

Atoms are either an integer number, float, string or a name.  You can use the predicate <code>atom()</code> to decide if its argument is an atom.  Expressions have an operator and a list of arguments. </p> <p>You can change the TeX output for an atom with Maxima's <code>texput</code> command.  E.g. <code>texput(blob, \"\\\\diamond\")</code> will display the atom <code>blob</code> as .  If you place <code>texput</code> commands in the question variables, this affects the display everywhere in the question including the inputs.  E.g. if a student types in <code>blob</code> then the validation feedback should say something like \"your last answer was:  \\diamond \".</p> <p>Note that the underscore symbol is not an operator.  Thus <code>a_1</code> is an atom in maxima. Hence, the atoms <code>a1</code> and <code>a_1</code> are not considered to be algebraically equivalent.   If you would like to consolidate subscripts in students' input see the documentation on the input option <code>consolidatesubscripts</code> in the extra options.  Also note that since the underscore is not an operator, an expression such as <code>(a_b)_c</code> is not valid Maxima syntax, but <code>a_b_c</code> is a valid name for an atom.</p> <p>Display with subscripts is a subtle and potentially confusing issue because subscript notation in mathematics has many different uses.  For example,</p> <ol> <li>Subscripts denote a function of the natural numbers, e.g. when defining terms in a sequence a_1, a_2, a_3.  That is the subscript denotes function application.  a_n = a(n).</li> <li>Subscripts denote differentiation, e.g.  x_t  is the derivative of x  with respect to t.</li> <li>Subscripts denote coordinates in a vector, in  \\vec{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\cdots, v_n)  .</li> </ol> <p>There are many other possible uses for subscripts, especially in other subjects e.g. in physics or actuarial studies.</p> <p>Because Maxima considers subscripted expressions to be atoms, the default TeX output of an atom <code>V_alpha</code> from Maxima is  {\\it V\\_alpha}  (literally <code>{\\it V\\_alpha}</code>) and not  V_{\\alpha}  as a user might expect.  For this reason STACK intercepts and redefines how atoms with the underscore are displayed.  In particular STACK (but not core Maxima) takes an atom <code>A_B</code>, applies the <code>tex()</code> command to <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> separately and concatenates the result using subscripts.  For example, if you define</p> <pre><code>texput(A, \"{\\\\mathcal A}\");\ntexput(B, \"\\\\diamond\");\n</code></pre> <p>then <code>A_B</code> is now displayed as {{{\\mathcal A}}_{\\diamond}}.</p> <p>Below are some examples.</p> Maxima code Maxima's <code>tex()</code> command STACK (if different) STACK plain atoms <code>A_B</code> <code>{\\it A\\_B}</code> {\\it A\\_B} <code>{{A}_{B}}</code>  {{A}_{B}}  <code>A[1]</code> <code>A_{1}</code>  A_{1} <code>A1</code> <code>A_{1}</code>  A_{1}  <code>{\\it A1}</code>  {\\it A1}  <code>A01</code> <code>A_{1}</code>  A_{1}  <code>{\\it A01}</code>  {\\it A01}  <code>A_1</code> <code>A_{1}</code>  A_{1}  <code>A_x1</code> <code>{\\it A\\_x}_{1}</code>  {\\it A\\_x}_{1}  <code>{{A}_{x_{1}}}</code>  {{A}_{x_1}}  <code>{{A}_{{\\it x1}}}</code>  {{A}_{{\\it x1}}}  <code>A_BC</code> <code>{\\it A\\_BC}</code>  {\\it A\\_BC}  <code>{{A}_{{\\it BC}}}</code>  {{A}_{{\\it BC}}}  <code>A_alpha</code> <code>{\\it A\\_alpha}</code>  {\\it A\\_alpha} <code>{{A}_{\\alpha}}</code>  {{A}_{\\alpha}}  <code>alpha_1</code> <code>\\alpha_{1}</code>  \\alpha_{1}  <code>A_B_C</code> <code>{\\it A\\_B\\_C}</code>  {\\it A\\_B\\_C}  <code>{{{A}_{B}}_{C}}</code>  {A_B}_C  <code>x_t(1)</code> <code>{\\it x\\_t}\\left(1\\right)</code>  {\\it x\\_t}\\left(1\\right)  <code>{{\\it x\\_t}\\left(1\\right)}</code>  {{\\it x\\_t}\\left(1\\right)}  <code>A[1,2]</code> <code>A_{1,2}</code>  A_{1,2}  <p>Notes</p> <ol> <li>The maxima atoms <code>A1</code> and <code>A_1</code> are different, and are not algebraically equivalent.  If student input is using both forms, and this causes problems, look at the documentation on <code>consolidatesubscripts</code> in the extra options.</li> <li>in the above examples all the different expressions <code>A1</code>, <code>A_1</code>, <code>A[1]</code> and the atom <code>A01</code>: generate the same tex code <code>A_{1}</code>  A_{1}, and so are indistinguishable at the display level.  If you would like to display <code>A1</code> without subscripts, STACK provides the flag <code>tex_plain_atoms</code>.  If you set <code>tex_plain_atoms:true</code> in your question (probably before the <code>%_stack_preamble_end</code> to make sure this option is available to inputs), then the TeX functions will not split up atoms <code>A1</code> and display this with subscripts.  See examples above.</li> <li>The expression <code>x_t(1)</code> refers to the function <code>x_t</code> which is not an atom, and hence STACK's logic for displaying atoms with underscores does not apply (by design).  If you want to display a function name including a subscript you can explicitly use, e.g. <code>texput(x_t, \"x_t\");</code> to control the display, this is just not done automatically.</li> <li>When we split up atoms for display we have two separate atoms.  E.g. <code>x_h</code> will be split into atoms <code>x</code> and <code>h</code> temporarily and the TeX display of <code>x</code> and <code>h</code> evaluated.  For this reason, student's input will validate the parts of the subscript sparately.  In particular, if <code>h</code> is a question variable and a student types in the atom <code>x_h</code> then since <code>h</code> is forbidden input the student's <code>x_h</code> will be invalid as well.  This might cause problems, but these can be avoided when the teacher uses appropriate variable names.</li> </ol> <p>One situation where this design is not satisfactory is when you want to use both of the atoms <code>F</code> and <code>F_1</code> but with different display. For example <code>F</code> should display as {\\mathcal F} but <code>F_1</code> should display as  F_1 .  Such a situation is not hard to imagine, as it is often considered good style to have things like  F_1 \\in {\\mathcal F}.  The above design always splits up the atom <code>F_1</code> into <code>F</code> and <code>1</code>, so that the atom <code>F_1</code> will display as  {\\mathcal F}_1.  (This is actually what you normally expect, especially with the Greek letter subscripts.)  To avoid this problem the logic which splits up atoms containing an underscore checks the texput properties list. If an entry has been made for a specific atom then STACK's display logic uses the entry, and does not split an atom over the underscore.  In the above example, use the following texput commands.</p> <pre><code>texput(F, \"{\\\\mathcal F}\");\ntexput(F_1, \"{F_1}\");\n</code></pre> <p>With this code <code>F</code> displays as {\\mathcal F}, the atom <code>F_1</code> displays as  F_1 , and every subscript will display with calligraphic, e.g. <code>F_alpha</code> displays as {\\mathcal F}_{\\alpha}.  There is no way to code the reverse logic, i.e. define a special display only for the unique atom <code>F</code>.</p> <p>Note that the scientific units code redefines and then assumes that symbols represent units.  E.g. <code>F</code> is assumed to represent Farad, and all units are typeset in Roman type, e.g.  \\mathrm{F}  rather than the normal  F . This is typically the right thing to do, but it does restrict the number of letters which can be used for variable names in a particular question.  To overcome this problem you will have to redefine some atoms with texput.  For example,</p> <pre><code>stack_unit_si_declare(true);\ntexput(F_a, \"F_a\");\n</code></pre> <p>will display the atom <code>F_a</code> as F_a, i.e. not in Roman.  If you <code>texput(F, \"F\")</code> the symbol <code>F</code> is no longer written in Roman, as you would expect from units.  This may be sensible if Farad could not possibly appear in context, but students might type a range of subscripted atoms involving <code>F</code>.</p> <p>The use of texput is global to a question. There is no way to display a particular atom differently in different places (except perhaps in the feedback variables, which is currently untested: assume texput is global).</p> <p>How would you generate the tex like  A_{1,2} ?  STACK's <code>sequence</code> command (see below) does output its arguments separated by a comma, so <code>sequence(1,2)</code> is displayed as  {1,2} , however the Maxima command <code>A_sequence(1,2)</code> refers to the function <code>A_sequence</code>, (since the underscore is not an operator).  Hence STACK's logic for splitting up atoms containing the underscore does not apply.  (In any case, even if the display logic did split up function names we would still have the issue of binding power to sort out, i.e. do we have the atom with parts <code>A</code> and <code>sequence(1,2)</code> or the function named <code>A</code> and <code>sequence</code>?)  To create an output like  A_{1,2}  you have no option but to work at the level of display.  Teachers can create an inert function which displays using subscripts.</p> <pre><code>texsub(a,b)\n</code></pre> <p>is typeset as {a}_{b} i.e. <code>{a}_{b}</code> in LaTeX.  For example,</p> <ul> <li><code>texsub(A, sequence(1,2))</code> will display as {{A}_{1, 2}},</li> <li>with simplification off, <code>texsub(F,1-2)</code> will be displayed as {F}_{1-2}.</li> </ul> <p>Note that the process of converting <code>theta_07</code> into the intermediate <code>texsub</code> form internally results in the <code>texsub(theta,7)</code> which removes the leading zero.  This is a known issue, for which a work around is to directly use <code>texput(theta_07, \"{{\\\\theta}_{07}}\")</code> or <code>texsub(theta,\"07\")</code>.  The second option does not produce optimal LaTeX, since it uses TeX <code>mbox</code>, e.g. <code>{{\\theta}_{\\text{07}}}</code>.</p>"},{"location":"en/CAS/Validator/","title":"Bespoke validators and feedback","text":"<p>The extra option <code>validator</code> to a particular input allows additional bespoke validation, based on a function defined by the question author.

Examples of this behaviour are discussed in Issue #1211 and on the Zulip Community chat.</p> <p>It seems that this behaviour is related to calculus functions like <code>limit</code> and <code>integrate</code> in the question variables, independent of what the validator does. As a workaround, it often helps to forcefully evaluate such expressions using <code>ev(..., simp)</code>, e.g. try <code>c : ev(int(e^(s*x),x,0,1), simp);</code> instead of <code>c : int(e^(s*x),x,0,1);</code>.</p> <p>Also, Maxima was originally designed as desktop software and it has an \"interactive mode\" somewhat hard-wired into the core code.  Try <code>integrate(x^n,x)</code> in a blank Maxima desktop session for an example.  The interactive mode has it's place, but if a validator uses one of the functions which has an interactive mode, and the student triggers this behaviour, then there will be a timeout.  We have looked at switching this off, but that's not completely possible.

Typically this arises from where Maxima needs to expand out the brackets by comparing <code>(x-a)^59999</code> with a similar expression.  It is very hard to ensure this kind of calculation is impossible so in general this situation will arise from time to time.  The PHP scripts have a timeout, but on Linux systems you can also ensure the underlying LISP process is killed off using <code>timeout</code> command in Linux.  This is particularly valuable for production systems where stability is essential.</p> <ol> <li>Check that your Linux has the <code>timeout</code> command.  Because this is not standard we have not included this mechanism by default.</li> <li>Make sure STACK is working.</li> <li>Set the CAS connection timeout variable as normal in the STACK settings.  E.g. you might choose 5 seconds</li> <li> <p>Use the following Maxima command</p> <p>timeout --kill-after=6s 6s maxima</p> </li> </ol> <p>It is important that the timeout time is longer than the CAS connection timeout.  That way, PHP gives up first and degrades gracefully.  The OS then kills the process later.  If you choose the timeout to be the same or less, PHP may not have gathered enough data to degrade gracefully.  </p> <p>The above can be used with either a direct Maxima connection, or with the image created as described below.</p>"},{"location":"en/Installation/Optimising_Maxima/#compiled-lisp-image-of-the-stack-libraries","title":"Compiled Lisp image of the STACK libraries","text":"<p>Maxima can be run with a number of different Lisp implementations.

They are based on the concept of \"unit testing\" from software development. Question variables can be included in the tests; indeed these are needed to define test inputs in the context of random values.</p> <p>Each test assigns values to</p> <ol> <li>any/all of the inputs.  These values may, naturally, depend on the    question variables.</li> <li>values for the score and any penalty.</li> <li>Answer notes from each of    the potential response trees.</li> </ol> <p>The teacher can opt to run the question tests from the preview window.  STACK automatically takes each test, assigns the values to inputs and attempts to submit it.  The results of the last answer note from each potential response tree is compared to that specified by the teacher.  Notice that this is a limitation of the system.  Specifying the complete route through the potential response tree would be too difficult and would discourage teachers from writing tests.</p> <p>If the score, penalty and answer note generated by each potential response tree matches that specified by the teacher, then the test will PASS, otherwise the test will FAIL. Note that failure of a test is a mismatch between outputs and expected outputs, not necessarily a sign that something is wrong with the question itself!</p> <p>The teacher can also examine by hand the outcomes generated by each step of each test, including full feedback generated.</p> <p>In this way, the teacher can record, within the question itself, how they expect the marking scheme to work for a variety of student answers.</p>"},{"location":"en/STACK_question_admin/Testing/#writing-tests","title":"Writing tests","text":"<ol> <li>Author and save your question.</li> <li>Navigate to the \"STACK question dashboard\".

If you start your test case with the tag <code>RAW:</code> (case sensitive) then the remainder of your input will be used as a raw string.  E.g. if your test case is <code>RAW:2 x</code> then your input test case will be <code>2 x</code>.  Note, this feature does not evaluate the expression further, and values of question variables will not be used as part of constructing the input for this test case.  However, the potential response tree will have access to the question variables later.  For example, if <code>n:42</code> in the question variables then typically student's who input <code>n</code> will get a validation error.  <code>RAW:n</code> allows you to create a test case, which will be displayed as <code>n</code> but later the PRTs will pick up the question variables.  This feature is intended to test invalid input rather than evaluation of test cases constructed from the random variables.  We can't have it both ways!</p> <p>If you start your test case with the tag <code>CT:</code> (case sensitive) then the remainder of your input will be evaluated as a castext string.  E.g. if your test case is  <code>CT:{#a#}{#v#}</code> then the castext <code>{#a#}{#v#}</code> will be evaluated, and the values of variables <code>a</code> and <code>v</code> placed next to each other to create an input string. This feature can be used to test input settings, such as insert stars, is working leading to a \"score\" state rather than an invalid state.  Please do not use <code>CT:{@a@}</code> which will generate LaTeX output!  For test-case construction we need to create Maxima syntax, not LaTeX.</p> <p>On the question testing page is a \"Send to CAS\" button.  Pressing this sends the question variables and general feedback to a special page which enables more efficient authoring of the feedback in the context of the values of the variables.

If you want to construct a simplified test case then wrap this in <code>ev(... , simp)</code> to simplify the expression generating the test case.  This behaviour is required to enable construction of un-simplified test cases.</p> <p>Test cases are always written using the period <code>.</code> as the decimal separator.  This corresponds to strict Maxima syntax, which teachers should always use.</p> <p>You can (and should) construct test cases based on invalid expressions.  If the raw testcase expression cannot be sent to the CAS, e.g. a missing bracket, then this invalidity will be tested.</p> <p>While test case construction uses <code>simp:false</code> Maxima must \"evaluate\" the expression prior to the result being used by an input as a test case.  This will replace variables by their values.  E.g. the typical case is to define a variable such as <code>ta</code> as the teacher's answer in the question variables field and use this throughout the question.  This answer will either be simplified, or not, when the question variables are evaluated.  To construct a test case using the teacher's answer use <code>ta</code> as the test case input.</p> <p>It is easier to create a number of variables in the question variables field for wrong answers, e.g. <code>wa1</code>, <code>wa2</code>, and construct the test cases in the question variables in advance.</p> <p>For matrix inputs the test case must be a correct Maxima statement, e.g. <code>matrix([1,2],[2,3])</code>.  There is currently no option to construct test cases by filling in individual input boxes here, which restricts the ability to create test cases of individual syntactically invalid matrix entries.  Similarly, for the textarea and equivalence reasoning input types the test case should be constructed as a list, just as the teacher's answer field is constructed.</p> <p>Some evaluations in Maxima do actually more than just replace existing variables with the values from the question variables. For example, in Maxima try</p> <pre><code>simp:false;\nf:x*sin(1/x);\nlimit(f,x,0);\n</code></pre> <p>Notice here, that while <code>simp:false</code> the limit is still evaluated.  This is not \"simplification\".  For the full story, please refer to the Maxima docs on the <code>ev</code> command.</p> <p>In this case, you can prevent evaluation of limits by using an apostrophe in the test case construction to prevent evaluation.</p> <pre><code>simp:false;\nf:x*sin(1/x);\n'limit(f,x,0);\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"en/STACK_question_admin/Testing/#test-case-construction-and-mcq","title":"Test case construction and MCQ","text":"<p>Remember that MCQ input types return a CAS expression.

This little booklet collects together for reference some of the stepping stones of experiences in the development of these basic algebraic skills.</p> <p>A guiding factor in the categorisation of the contents has been the splitting of an item into a range of separate cases where it was felt that these cases constituted significantly different experiences for a learner whose development in that item was at an early stage. Manipulation with numerical fractions has been dealt with fairly extensively in this sense, as it was considered that experience with a wide range of possibilities was essential in order for later progress in algebra. Similarly situations in which a sum or difference of two terms in an algebraic expression has to be mentally perceived as a single item, have been noted explicitly. On the other hand, there has been an attempt to balance the conflicting aims of comprehensiveness and conciseness. So, for example, in listing the three kinds of behaviour for the roots of a quadratic equation, it was considered unnecessary to split this further and give two different graphs for each case, relating to whether the turning point was a maximum or minimum, as this was felt to be a less significant distinction at this stage in the development. Generally speaking things have been broken down in the hope that they will be put together, and if a learner is unable to see why an item comes in so many 'different' cases, having developed to a stage where the distinctions seem insignificant, this is to be regarded as a success!</p> <p>This booklet is intended for use by teachers rather than by pupils. However, as well as listing the items from the pupil's viewpoint in getting to grips with what you actually do in a particular situation, the language has also been chosen with an eye on teacher-pupil dialogue. Thus practical descriptions such as ''two-term expression\", ''no number in front of the \" and ''no factor in common with\" have been used instead of technical expressions such as ''binomial\", ''monic\" and ''relatively prime\". As an aid to describing the items, each is accompanied by at least one illustrative example. Sometimes only the 'question' has been given, sometimes the 'answer' has also been given and sometimes the 'working' has been included as well. In each case, the aim of keeping the booklet as concise as possible has been at the forefront, and the 'answer' or 'working' have been included only if it was felt that doing so would give a clearer picture of the experiences in algebraic manipulation encompassed by the item.</p> <p>Finally it should be emphasised that, in summarising this collection of pupil oriented steps in algebraic manipulation, there is no desire to lay out a prescribed route that everyone must follow. On the contrary it is hoped that the booklet might be thought of simply as a pocket map of the landscape.</p> <p>I should like to thank Ian Evans and Tom Roper for their valuable comments in the preparation of this booklet.</p> <p>Tony Barnard</p>"},{"location":"en/STACK_question_admin/Library/Algebra_refresher/#1-combinations-of-arithmetic-operations","title":"1 Combinations of arithmetic operations","text":"<p> (+)+(+), (+)+(-), (-)+(+), (-)+(-) \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad Example: 7+(-6), 5-(-9), -6-(+4), (-3) \\times (-1),</p> <p> (+)-(+), (+)-(-), (-)-(+), (-)-(-) \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad Example: (+2) \\times (-7), (-6) \\div (+2), (-9) \\div (-3),</p> <p> (+)\\times(+), (+)\\times(-), (-)\\times(+), (-)\\times(-) \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad Example: 2-3+1, -6+2+7, (4\\times 3)+2 </p> <p> (+)\\div(+), (+)\\div(-), (-)\\div(+), (-)\\div(-) \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad Example: 4 \\times(3+2), 4+(3\\times 2), 3-(4\\div 2).</p> <p>'Brackets, Of, Division,Multiplication, Addition,Subtraction.'</p> <p>Powers of whole numbers   \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad Example: 2^3 \\times 2^4 = 2^7, 2^5 \\div 2^2 = 2^3, (5^2)^3 = 5^6, (2 \\times 3)^4 = 2^4 \\times 3^4.</p> <p>'Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication,Addition, Subtraction.'</p> <p>Negative and fractional powers  \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad Example: 2^{-1}=\\frac{1}{2}, 2^0 = 1, 3^{-2} = \\frac{1}{3^2} = \\frac{1}{9}, 9^\\frac{1}{2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3, 8^\\frac{1}{3} = \\sqrt[3]{8} =2.</p>"},{"location":"en/STACK_question_admin/Library/Algebra_refresher/#2-factorisation-of-whole-numbers","title":"2 Factorisation of whole numbers","text":"<p>Prime factorisations  \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad Example: 228 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 19, 1734 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 17^2.</p> <p>Highest common factor  \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad Example:   HCF of 228 and 1734 is 2 \\times 3 = 6.</p> <p>Least common multiple   \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad Example:  LCM of 228 and 1734 is 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 17^2 \\times 19 = 65892.</p> <p>Reduction of fractions to lowest terms   \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad Example: \\frac{10}{18} = \\frac{5}{9}.</p> <p>Change of improper fractions to mixed fractions, and vice-versa \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad Example: \\frac{13}{5} = 2\\frac{3}{5}, 1\\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{15}{8}.</p> <p>Products and quotients of surds  \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad Example: \\sqrt{12} \\times \\sqrt{6} = \\sqrt{2^2 \\times 3} \\times \\sqrt{2 \\times 3} = 2 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{2} = 6\\sqrt{2},  \\frac{\\sqrt{108}}{\\sqrt{150}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2^2 \\times 3^3}}{\\sqrt{2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2^2 \\times 3^3}{2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 3^2}{5^2}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{5}. </p>"},{"location":"en/STACK_question_admin/Library/Algebra_refresher/#3-addition-and-subtraction-of-fractions","title":"3 Addition and subtraction of fractions","text":""},{"location":"en/STACK_question_admin/Library/Algebra_refresher/#31-nature-of-denominators","title":"3.1 Nature of denominators","text":"<p>Same denominator \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad Example: \\frac{4}{7} + \\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{5}{6} -

E.g. to assemble a correct mathematical proof.</p> <p>This page provides a quick-start to authoring whole questions.  There are a number of parts to authoring a Parson's problem:</p> <ol> <li>Defining strings and creating drag and drop area using the Parson's block.</li> <li>Linking the Parson's block to a STACK input (string input).</li> <li>Assessing the student's answer and providing meaningful feedback automatically.</li> </ol> <p>While drag and drop is certainly not new in automatic assessment, these problems have become popular in computer science, e.g. Parsons (2006).</p> <p>Parson\u2019s problems enable students to focus on the structure and meaning, by providing all the right words but just not initially in the right order. Learning mathematical proof is well-known to be very difficult for most students. The scaffolding provided by Parson's problems has been found to be very useful to students in discrete mathematics. This may well be due to the expert reversal effect. The expert reversal effect is a well-established phenomenon that what is useful for a beginner is quite different, perhaps the opposite, of what is useful for an expert. Even when independent proof writing is the final goal of instruction, it is very likely that Parson's problems have an important place in formative learning towards that goal.</p> <p>Traditionally Parson\u2019s problems require the student to create an ordered list. For mathematical proofs, we believe it is more natural to ask students to create a tree. Parson's problems in mathematics, especially proofs, do not always have a unique answer which is considered correct. Hence, there are challenges in deciding what a correct answer is in particular cases, and how to develop authoring tools to robustly create problems with reliable marking algorithms. For example, in a proof of  We might expect/require two conscious and separate blocks</p> <ol> <li>Assume A, \\cdots, hence B.</li> <li>Assume B, \\cdots, hence A.</li> </ol> <p>The order in which these two sub-proofs are presented is (normally) irrelevant.  That is the if and only if proof construct allows its two sub-proofs to commute.  This is precisely the same sense in which A=B and B=A are equivalent. There are blocks within the proof which can change order. Furthermore, since proofs are often nested blocks these sub-proofs may themselves have acceptable options for correctness. Proofs often contain local variables.  Use of explicit block-structures clarify the local scope of variables, and the local scope of assumptions.</p> <p>STACK provides \"proof construction functions\" with arguments. For example, an if and only if proof would be represented as <code>proof_iff(A,B)</code>.  Here <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are either sub-proofs or strings to be shown to the student.</p> <p>If the student has an opportunity to indicate more structure, then the assessment logic becomes considerably simpler, more reliable and transparent. Actually, we think there is significant educational merit in making this structure explicit and consciously separating proof-structure from the finer grained details. It is true that professional mathematicians often omit indicating explicit structure, they abbreviate and omit whole blocks (\"the other cases are similar\") but these are all further examples of expert reversal.</p> <p>Notes</p> <ul> <li>Lists are a special case of a tree with one root (the list creation function) and an arbitrary number of nodes in order.  Hence our design explicitly includes traditional Parson's problems as a special case.</li> <li>Teachers who do not want to scaffold explicit block structures (e.g. signal types of proof blocks) can choose to restrict students to (i) flat lists, or (ii) lists of lists.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"en/Specialist_tools/Drag_and_drop/Parsons/#troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","text":"<p>Please see the troubleshooting page for known issues and how to resolve them.</p>"},{"location":"en/Specialist_tools/Drag_and_drop/Parsons/#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<p>Please follow the examples below to understand how the components work.

E.g. their answer must be something correct such as <code>x=1 or x=2</code>, not something sloppy like <code>x=1 or 2</code> or <code>x=1,2</code>. It certainly can't be something wrong such as <code>x=1 and x=2</code> which is often seen in written answers!</p> <p>Note that students may not take square roots of both sides of an equation.

Yes, I (CJS) believe they should but to require this from the input type now would be too big a step for students and their teachers. Students are already being expected to use connectives such as <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> correctly.  The input type uses these connectives and in the future options may be added to this input type which require students to be explicit about logical connectives, especially when we add support for implication in addition to equivalence.

Typically, users do not do so many actions that the lag would be noticeable.</p> <p>At 3. like serialisers deserialisers are simpler if the state is formulated suitably. Here we can often use the serialiser-function to our advantage when comparing the current state and incoming state and then do the minimal set of updates. Alternatively, simply throwing everything away and rebuilding from scratch is a valid tactic, maybe not efficient but this is a place where premature optimisation is often pointless.</p> <p>At 4. always do the default state building before binding anything, as the binding function call will at that moment read the current value from the input and if it find something from there it will deserialise it on top of the current state.</p> <p>At 5.

However, the position has been stored in a String encoded in JSON format and cannot directly be used in STACK-side logic. The JSON format is however very handy if you create objects to store dynamically and want to represent things of more complex nature, but in this example we could have just as well have had two separate Numeric inputs storing just the raw 'x' and 'y' coordinates separately as raw numbers and in that case we could have used them directly in STACK's grading logic.</p> <p>If needed, JSON is not impossible to parse in STACK, but it is not easy (as in JavaScript) because Maxima has no map data-structures and is not object oriented.

Basically, if you want to represent vectors, lines or circles or anything that can be defined with just two points. <code>stack_jxg.bind_point_dual(inputRef, point1, point2)</code> will store the positions of the points into a single input as a list of lists, <code>stack_jxg.bind_point_relative(inputRef, point1, point2)</code> will also generate a list but in it the second point is represented relative to the first, and finally <code>stack_jxg.bind_point_direction(inputRef, point1, point2)</code> will provide the first point as coordinates and the second point as an angle and distance from the first.</p> <p>Starting from 4.4 there is only one new bind function <code>stack_jxg.bind_list_of(inputRef, list)</code> which takes a list of points and/or sliders and stores it into a single input. It only works if the size or order of the list does not change during page loads, however the list can change its shape for variants of the question. The primary use target for this are the vertices of polygons, but one can probably come up with something else as well, it does work as a quick and dirty way of storing the whole graph state if the graph can be defined just by points and sliders.</p> <p>There are also two new functions related to dealing with groups of objects and matching inputs. For situations where the answer consists of multiple elements and it is possible that not all get moved one can use <code>stack_jxg.define_group(list)</code> which takes a list of points and/or sliders and makes it so that touching any one of them will trigger them all to be considered as touched and thus generates inputs. There is also <code>stack_jxg.starts_moved(object)</code> which takes a point or a slider and marks it as touched from the start, this may be of use if the graph is an optional part and the actual grading depends of other parts or if one wants to use PRT feedback as a way for describing the status of the graph and needs the objects to be transferred onto the CAS side without interaction from the student.</p>"},{"location":"en/Specialist_tools/JSXGraph/Binding/#convenience-tools-for-generating-lists-of-values","title":"Convenience tools for generating lists of values.","text":"<p>If you want to output a list of values without Maxima's normal bracket symbols you can use</p> <pre><code>stack_disp_comma_separate([a,b,sin(pi)]);\n</code></pre> <p>This function turns a list into a string representation of its arguments, without braces.

One example of this would be asking students to identify or shade in a certain region in a graph, such as part of a Venn diagram, identifying the region of integration for an iterated integral, or showing that (for example), two sixths is equal to one third. In this case, you will need to write the binding more explicitly, using the steps listed above as a framework. An example is given below, in which we ask the student to \"shade\" in one third of a circle divided into six equal segments.</p> <p>Let us first assume that we will hard-code this question to always ask students to shade in one third of a circle divided into sixths. This is not too difficult to generalise, and it keeps the code clean. Then let us define a model answer as the list:</p> <pre><code>ta: [1,1,0,0,0,0];\n</code></pre> <p>We interpret this as two of the six sectors in our eventual graph being shaded, and four of them being unshaded, with 1 representing on and 0 representing off. Our student input, <code>ans1</code>, will then be a normal algebraic input.</p> <p>Now we can create the question text. Firstly, we state the instructions for the student and create the board and associated objects.</p> <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Shade some regions of the diagram below so that it represents the fraction \\(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\).

Below is one approach to creating a vector plot question. Note that it assumes you are working with a plaintext editor and so <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, and <code>&amp;&amp;</code> are all viable options. If you work in a different editor (such as a the Moodle default) you may like to define your own functions to prevent conversion to <code>&amp;lt;</code>, <code>&amp;gt;</code> or <code>&amp;amp;</code> upon saving. </p> <p>Let us first assume a general vector function, called <code>F</code>. In the question variables, we could define <code>fx</code> and <code>fy</code> and then define <code>F: [fx,fy]</code>. If we were wanting to instead plot a gradient, we could define a function <code>f</code> and then define its gradient as <code>F: [diff(f,x),diff(f,y)]</code>. We will also need a version of <code>F</code> that uses valid JavaScript syntax. You might like to convert manually using something like <code>fx_jsx: ssubst(\"**\",\"^\",string(fx))</code>, though this relies on you knowing the form of the function and can cause problems with the unary minus. A better option could be to use JXG.JessieCode. Lastly, we want a JavaScript function to output the direction at a given point. Something like the the following suffices.</p> <pre><code>var F = function(x,y) { return [{@fx_jsx@},{@fy_jsx@}] };\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we want to know where we are plotting. Keeping everything in terms of the plotting axes and number of vectors will prove convenient. If we choose the number of vectors in the x-direction to be <code>num_x</code> and similarly for y to be <code>num_y</code>, we can set up the following: </p> <pre><code>var xi = -2, yf = 2, xf = 2, yi = -2\nvar axes = [xi, yf, xf, yi]\nvar num_x = 20, num_y = 20\nvar dx = 1/num_x*(xf - xi)\nvar dy = 1/num_y*(yf - yi)\n</code></pre> <p>Our goal will be to plot vectors at every grid point defined by these steps in x and y called <code>dx</code> and <code>dy</code>.</p> <p>Before we iterate through this, we need to define the function that will actually plot the vectors.</p> <pre><code>var createVector = function(px, py) {\n    var vec = F(px,py) /* Compute the value of the function here */\n    var vecScaler = 1/Math.sqrt(vec[0]**2 + vec[1]**2)\n    var plotVec = [dx*vec[0]*vecScaler, dy*vec[1]*vecScaler]\n    var tip = [px + plotVec[0], py + plotVec[1]]\n    board.create('arrow',[[px,py],tip],{\n        color: \"#1f77b4\", opacity: 0.66, lastArrow: {type: 2, size: 4},\n        fixed: true, highlight: false\n    });\n    board.create('point',[px,py],{\n        color: \"#1f77b4\", size: 0.1, strokeOpacity: 0.66, fillOpacity: 0.75,\n        highlight: false, fixed: true, withLabel: false\n    });\n}\n</code></pre> <p>A couple of things to note: Firstly, the variable <code>vecScaler</code> is always equal to the reciprocal of the length of the vector, which means that in this example it will always plot a \"unit\" vector (where a unit here is the grid size). This can (and perhaps should) be changed unless you wish to use colour to denote different vector length (which is poor accessibility practice on its own). Secondly, these vectors are eminating from the grid point, which is plotted itself with a transparent dot. In fact, everything is partially transparent to avoid excessive busyness in the plot. You could easily set this up to instead plot with the centre of the arrow being the location, or could tweak any of the other visual settings. In general, it is good to indicate where the vector originates for clarity. </p> <p>Now we can finally plot the vectors. </p> <pre><code>var i, j;  \nfor (i = xi/dx - 1; i &lt;= xf/dx + 1; i++) {\n  for (j = yi/dy - 1; j &lt;= yf/dy + 1; j++) {\n    createArrow(i*dx,j*dy);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that the vectors are being plotted from just outside the desired area so that they can enter the plot from outside if needed. Now we have a vector plot! </p> <p>The scaling factor <code>vecScaler</code> is the last thing to consider seriously. It is often important to distinguish between different vector lengths, but just setting <code>vecScaler = 1</code> will usually render the plot illegible with huge vectors shooting all over the place. There is no shortage of ways to scale, but one way the author has found helpful is to use a sigmoidal curve like \\tan^{-1}(x). Here is one option: </p> <pre><code>var myScaler = function(vec,a,b) { return a*(Math.PI/2 - Math.atan(a/b*Math.sqrt(vec[0]**2 + vec[1]**2))) }\n</code></pre> <p>for some tuning constants a and b. Note that this function produces a multiplying factor, not the desired length directly. b is the maximum length of the vector relative to the grid size, which is often set to either 1 or 1.414 (the former being good for vectors that tend to point along gridlines and the latter being good for vectors that tend to point in the direction of the diagonals, or if you like a little bit of overlap). a is a measure of how fast the vector reaches the maximum length. You could tweak the values of a and b for each question, or you could pair up functions and scaling factors in the question variables when randomising. Regardless, it might be a good idea to copy-paste the graphing code into the question note so that you can check the scaling when deploying variants.</p>"},{"location":"en/Topics/Chemistry/","title":"Support for chemistry","text":"<p>STACK provides a comprehensive chemical data sheet for use in numerical problems.</p> <p>To include chemical data use the following within your STACK question (question variables).</p> <pre><code>stack_include_contrib(\"chemistry.mac\");\n</code></pre> <p>Developer notes: </p> <ul> <li>During development to load the code local to your development server use <code>stack_include(\"contribl://chemistry.mac\");</code></li> </ul>"},{"location":"en/Topics/Chemistry/#using-chemical-data","title":"Using chemical data","text":"<p>Chemical data is stored in a (large) associative array <code>%_STACK_CHEM_ELEMENTS</code> using the standard chemical symbols as keys in the array.

A traditional proof is shown below. This proof was published by DeMorgan in 1838.  According to Cajori (1918) this is the first use of the name \"mathematical induction\", although DeMorgan calls it \"successive induction\".</p> <p>The sum of any number of successive odd numbers, beginning from unity, is a square number, namely the square of half the even number which follows the last odd number. Let this proposition be true in any one single instance; that is, n being some whole number, let 1,\\, 3,\\, 5,\\, \\ldots up to 2n+1 put together give (n+1)^2. Then the next odd number being 2n+3, the sum of all the odd numbers up to 2n+3 will be (n+1)^2+2n+3, or n^2+4n+4, or (n+2)^2.  But n+2 is half of the even number next following 2n+3: consequently, if the proposition be true of any one set of odd numbers, it is true of one more.  But it is true of the first odd number 1, for this is the square of half the even number next following.  Consequently, being true of 1, it is true of 1+3; being true of 1+3, it is true of 1+3+5; being true of 1+3+5, it is true of 1+3+5+7, and so on, {\\em ad infinitum}.</p> <p>This is the original version.</p> <p></p> <p>This proof is dense, difficult to read and lacks structure.  Since DeMorgan's day, proof by induction is a slightly more formal method of proof consisting of four parts, (i) a statement to be proved, (ii) a base case, (iii) the induction step, and (iv) the conclusion.  Here is a modern version.</p> <p>Let P(n) be the statement \"\\sum_{k=1}^n (2k-1) = n^2\".</p> <p>Since \\sum_{k=1}^1 (2k-1) = 1 = 1^2 we see P(1) is true.</p> <p>Assume P(n) is true.

For example, an if and only if proof would be represented as <code>proof_iff(A,B)</code>, where both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are sub-proofs. Proof construction functions don't typically modify their arguments, but some proof construction functions have simplification properties.  For example <code>proof_iff(A,B)</code> is normally equivalent to <code>proof_iff(B,A)</code>.</p> <p>STACK supports the following types of proof construction functions.  The following are general proofs</p> <ul> <li><code>proof()</code>: general, unspecified proof.</li> <li><code>proof_c()</code>: general proof, with commutative arguments.  Typically each argument will be another proof block type.</li> <li><code>proof_opt()</code>: steps in a proof which are optional.  It assumes a single step.  Wrap each optional step individually.</li> </ul> <p>The following represent particular types of proof.</p> <ul> <li><code>proof_iff()</code>.  This proof must have two arguments.  These arguments are assumed to commute.</li> <li><code>proof_cases()</code>. In proof by exhaustive cases, the first element is fixed, and it typically used to describe/justify the cases.  E.g. \" is either odd or even\".  The remaining cases commute, and typically each argument will be another proof block type.</li> <li><code>proof_goal()</code>. This proof seeks to establish the goal.  The last element is fixed, and it typically used to describe/justify the goal.  E.g. \"f is continuously differentiable\".  The remaining cases commute, and typically each argument will be another proof block type.</li> <li><code>proof_ind()</code>.  A proof by induction must have four arguments.  The 1st and 4th are fixed position (defining the statement and conclusion), whereas the 2nd and 3rd commute (for the base case, and induction step).</li> </ul> <p>It is relatively easy to add in new functions to represent a particular type of proof.</p> <p>The variable <code>proof_types</code> is a list holding the names of all proof construction functions.   E.g. this list is used by the predicate <code>proofp</code> to decide if the operator represents a proof.</p> <p><code>proof_validatep</code> is a validation function: the argument must be a tree built from proof construction functions as operators (with the right number of arguments in some cases) or atoms which are integer or strings.</p> <p><code>proof_flatten</code> turns a proof-tree into a list of steps.  E.g. <code>proof_flatten(proof_iff(A,B))</code> is just <code>[A, B]</code>.  This function is useful when the teacher creates a structured tree, but a student's proof is a flat list.</p> <p><code>proof_normal</code> returns a normalised proof-tree, e.g. sorting arguments of commutative proof construction functions.  Note, this function does not change keys, so will not match proofs using integer keys with a proof using string keys.</p> <p><code>proof_alternatives</code> returns a list of all proof trees which are alternatives to its argument.  E.g. <code>proof_iff(A,B))</code> has two alternatives:  <code>[proof_iff(A,B),proof_iff(B,A)]</code>.  This function recurses over all sub-proofs to generate any tree which might be equivalent.  Note, if a student is correct then using <code>proof_normal</code> will match their answer with the teacher's.  However, when trying to identify possible mistakes we need to find the tree which is closest to one of the acceptable proof trees.

The whole design could be built on numbered keys (and these are valid), but string keys are easier to remember and easier to interpret when looking at students' attempts.
