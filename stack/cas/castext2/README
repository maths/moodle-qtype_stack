Some key differences to the Abacus era castext:

 - We now have parser grammar level logic for some key blocks:
   'if' has its branches handled in parser and does not require the complex
        postprocessing it did in the old system.
   'comment' and 'escape' blocks do actually work for any content even broken
        syntax.

 - Block logic now consists of a compile step and a postprocess step and is 
   a single pass system as opposed to the old one where we parsed the generated
   output as long as we had something to process in the output. Now blocks 
   generate an CAS expression in the compile phase that will either generate 
   a straight string value or a list representing parameters for a postprocess
   step that will turn those paramters to a raw string.

   There is no direct connection between compile and postprocess and the compile
   step can thus be cached and its result is processable even even without 
   knowing the original code used to generate it.

 - '@' and '#' chars are now allowed within {@...@} and {#...#} blocks again due
   to the parser grammar being better.

 - Mathmode paintting is being done outside the actual parser to simplify 
   the parser grammar and to allow them to be tuned separately. The mathmode
   identification logic can now ignore 'comment'-blocks and block parameters
   leading to more logical results.

 - Overall there are less steps in the process as the parser grammar now 
   actually describes a nested block system and the number of 'special' cases
   is lesser.

Like the MaximaParser this parser comes from the UI side of Stateful and is 
therefore first implemented for JavaScript client-side processing. Should 
the parser grammar need fixes they need to be done there. PEG.js used there
has PHP as one generation targets and seems to be better supportted and overall
easier to use than the old Abacus parser built on PHP-PEG.
