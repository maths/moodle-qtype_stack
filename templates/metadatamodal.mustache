    @template core/modal_copytoclipboard

    This template renders a modal. The body contains a readonly input text field.
    The Footer contains a button "Copy to clipboard" that copies the content
    of the text field into the clipboard.
    The purpose of the dialog element is to copy a permalink of a section into
    the clipboard. Thus, the header of the modal dialog contains the label "Permalink".

    Example context (json):
    {
        "text": "content for the input field that is being copied to the clipboard"
    }
}}
